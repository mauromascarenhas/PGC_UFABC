1034;Ice Statues Festival;Paradigms;7;"Every year, artists from around the world came to the city, where they make giant ice sculptures. The city becomes an open sky art gallery, since the sculptures are exposed in the street for weeks, without melting. This is because the average winter temperature in Harbin (time that will occur at the end of the world ICPC) is -20 degrees.
                    
                    The first step to make the sculpture is to assemble a large block of ice with the size requested by the artist. The blocks are cut from the glaciers of Harbin in blocks of standard height and depth, and several different lengths. The artist can determine the length he wishes his block of ice and the sculpture can begin to be carved.
                    
                    The lengths of the available blocks are {a1; a2; ...;  aN} and wished length by the artist is M.

1085;Babel;Graph;7;"John and Mary are brothers, and are enthusiastic about their courses on foreign languages. Each one is taking several language courses. When they get home they comment about grammar, vocabulary, culture of the different countries and so on. In one of those conversations they realized that some words are common to more than one language, even though the words may have different meanings in the languages. For example, the word ""amigo"" exists in Portuguese and Spanish and has the same meaning, while ""date"" is a word that exists in English and French and may have different meanings, since ""date"" is also a fruit, besides meaning a calendar date. On the other hand, ""red"" in Spanish is a network, while in English it is a color.
                    Thrilled by these findings, the brothers decided to write in a notepad all words in common they could think of, associating each word to a pair of languages. Observant and smart, John proposed a challenge to Mary: given one language to start and one language to finish, write down a sequence of words such that the first word is included in the vocabulary of the start language, and the last word is included in the vocabulary of the finish language. Two adjacent words in the sequence must be in the vocabulary of the same language. For example, if the start language is Portuguese and the finish language is French, Mary could write the sequence ""amigo actual date"" (Portuguese/Spanish, Spanish/English, English/French).
                    To John's surprise, Mary solved the problem rather easily. Annoyed by his sister's success, he decided to make the problem more difficult: Mary must find a solution in which the sequence has the smallest number of letters in total (not counting spaces between words), and, besides, two consecutive words must not have the same initial letter.
                    Note that the previous solution is now invalid, as ""amigo"" and ""actual"" share the same initial letter. It is possible, however, to find another solution, ""amigo red date"", with a total length equal to 12.
                    John did an extensive research on the Internet and compiled an enormous list of words, and challenged Mary to solve the problem.

	Loops may be digitalized for example using PCM (Pulse Code Modulation), a technique for representing analog signals used extensively in digital audio. In PCM, the magnitude of the signal is sampled at regular intervals, and the values sampled are stored in sequence. To produce the sound for the sampled data, the procedure is applied in reverse (demodulation).

Each card, therefore, has two characteristics: the number of figures and the type of figure. A set is a group of three cards such that, for each characteristic (number and figure), either the three cards are equal or the three cards are different.

	For example, in the figure below, (a) is a valid set, since all cards have the same figure type and all of them have a different number of figures.

In this game he plays a vampire that repeatedly comes into combat against vampires from other clans. Such battles are won or lost based on some characteristics of the opponents, with the help of a standard six-faced dice. For simplicity, we will consider only the fight between two vampires, Vampire 1 and Vampire 2. Each vampire has a vital energy (denoted respectively by EV1 and EV2). Besides, an attack force AT and a damage capacity D are also given.

	The combat is fought in turns, in the following way. At each turn, the dice is rolled; if the result value is less than or equal to AT, Vampire 1 wins the turn, otherwise Vampire 2 wins. The winner then sucks the value D from the loser\'s vital energy. That is, D points are subtracted from the loser's vital energy and added to the winner's vital energy. The combat continues until one of the fighters has EV less than or equal to zero.

	For example, suppose EV1=7, EV2=5, AT=2 and D=4. The dice is rolled and the result value is 3. Then, Vampire 2 wins the turn, and therefore 4 points are subtracted from EV1 and added to EV2. The new values for the vital energies would be EV1=3 and EV2=9. Notice that, if in the next turn Vampire 2 wins again, the combat ends. The values of AT and D are constant throughout the combat; only EV1 and EV2 vary.

In one dispute both participants receive a list with several regular expressions and for each regex the participants must calculate if several given words are recognized or not by the regex.

	As a member of the School you are participating, and want to win. So, to guarantee your victory, you have to write a program to solve the problem and let it executing in your Cool Stuff Calculator Machine at home.

1122;Account Book;Ad-Hoc;7;"The FCC (Foundation for Combating Corruption) dismantled a major corruption scheme in Nlogonia. During the operation, several account books, with notes documenting the illicit transactions carried out by the scheme, were seized by FCC agents.
	
	Each page on the account books contains some transactions (income or expense, in nilogos, the local currency of Nlogônia, whose symbol is N$) and the cash flow resulting from transactions on that page. For example, if a page recorded the following transactions: an income of N$ 7, an income of N$ 2, an expense of N$ 3, an income of N$ 1 and an expense of N$ 11, the cash flow on that page would be 7 + 2 - 3 + 1 - 11 = -4.
	
	However, to obstruct the work of the police, the offenders did not record in their account books the type of each transaction (income or expense). In the example above, the page would contain only the numbers 7, 2, 3, 1 and 11 (with no indication whether they were income or expense transactions). The cash flow for each page, however, was always recorded normally, with the signal (in this case, -4).
	
	To guarantee that the offenders are convicted, prosecutors must be able to determine with certainty whether each transaction is an income or an expense. In the example above, transaction N$ 7 was certainly an income, and transaction N$ 11 was certainly an expense. But we cannot say anything about transactions N$ 2, N$ 3, and N$ 1. Transactions N$ 2 and N$ 1 could have been income and in this case transaction N$ 3 would have been an expense; or N$ 1 and N$ 2 could have been expenses and in this case transaction N$ 3 would be an income.

Two notes for which the fundamental frequencies have a ratio of power of 2 (one is half of the other, one is double of the other, etc..) are perceived as very similar. Therefore, any notes with that kind of relationship are given the same name, as described below.
	
	There are twelve basic notes in a sequence of increasing frequency, each note separated from the previous note by the same distance in the musical scale (this distance is called a semitone). Seven of these twelve notes are represented by letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). The table below shows the distance, in semitones, between the notes. 

		Notice that there are five notes that are not represented by letters of the alphabet: the notes between A and B, between C and D, between D and E, betwen F and G and between G and A.
	
	Notes can be modified by two accidentals, called sharp and flat, represented respectively by the symbols `#' and `b'. A sharp raises the note a semitone, a flat lowers the note a semitone. A note with an accidental is denoted by the name of the note followed by the accidental symbol. Notice that with this scheme we can represent all twelve notes.

In each test, each question will have five alternatives (A, B, C, D and E), and the teacher will distribute one answer sheet for each student. At the end of the test, the answer sheets will be scanned and processed digitally to obtain the test score for each student. Initially, he asked a nephew, who knows computer programming, to write a program to extract the alternatives marked by the students in the answer sheets. The nephew wrote a good piece of software, but he couldn't finish it because he needs to study for the ICPC contest.
	

	During processing, the answer sheets are scanned in gray levels between 0 (full black) and 255 (total white). After detecting the position for the five rectangles corresponding to each of the alternatives of a question, the software calculates the average pixel gray level for each rectangle, returning an integer value corresponding to each alternative. If the rectangle was filled properly the average value is zero (all black). If the rectangle was left blank the average value is 255 (white total). Thus, ideally, if the average values for each alternative of a question are (255, 0, 255, 255, 255), we know that the student has marked alternative B for that question. However, as answer sheets are processed individually, the average gray level for a completely filled rectangle is not necessarily 0 (may be higher), and the value for a rectangle not filled is not necessarily 255 (may be less). Professor John determined that rectangle average gray levels would be divided into two classes: those with values equal or lower to 127 are considered black and those with values higher than 127 will be considered white.

The distance between cell (i0 , j0) and cell (i1 , j1) is max( |i0 - i1| , |j0 - j1| ) where |x| represents the absolute value of x. The electric priority of a location is its minimum distance to a power plant. With this in mind, you will number all possible locations with consecutive integers starting from 1.

Unfortunately, there’s no safe way for a spy to communicate within a war building, therefore the messages are always sent in code so that only the receiver is able to read and understand it.

	Once the carriages are arranged in the optimal order, all the train driver has to do, is drop the carriages off, one by one, at the stations for which the load is meant.
	
	The title “train swapper'' stems from the first person who performed this task, at a station close to a railway bridge. Instead of opening up vertically, the bridge rotated around a pillar in the center of the river. After rotating the bridge 90 degrees, boats could pass left or right.
	
	The first train swapper had discovered that the bridge could be operated with at most two carriages on it. By rotating the bridge 180 degrees, the carriages switched place, allowing him to rearrange the carriages (as a side effect, the carriages then faced the opposite direction, but train carriages can move either way, so who cares).
	
	Now that almost all train swappers have died out, the railway company would like to automate their operation.

1163;Angry Ducks;Mathematics;5;"In a far away land there are two cities, Nlogony, home of the Nlogonies, and Ducklogony, home of their neighbors, the Ducknese. These two cities have been at war for some time and now, in a try to win the war, the Ducknese intend to attack Nlogony with a slingshot that fires ducks. However, to avoid mistakes, they asked you to build a program that, given the values of the slingshot's height (h), the points where the Nlogony city begins (p1) and ends (p2), the shooting angle (α) and the launching speed, calculates if the projectile will hit the target. 

	
 
	For the calculations, assume that the gravity's acceleration is g=9,80665 and that π = 3,14159. 
                Input

Usually in these camps, students are divided into collective chalets  by gender and age, always with a supervisor or supervisor who, in addition to sleep ing in the cottage with the group, are also responsible for creating and executing several interesting and exciting activities for all ages. Among the many activities we can do mention of  games, excursions, Gymkhana Musical, Night competitions, etc.. On the first day of camp due to heavy rain, recreational activities were limited and the children were taken to the gymnasium. We conducted a contest and one of the activities consisted of the same group children in a circle (arranged in a counterclockwise direction) which would be removed one by one until only one child was left, which would be the winner. 
	
		 At the moment the child enters the circle it receives a small token containing a number between 1 and 500. Once the circle is formed, it is counted up to the number corresponding to the token the first child holds, beginning from the child besides him or her. The child where the  counting ends, should be removed from the group. The count starts again according to the number in the token the child who has just been eliminated. In order to make the game more interesting, when the number in the token is even, the counting is done clockwise, otherwise the counting is done in a counterclockwise direction.

1209;St. Petersburg Parties;Ad-Hoc;7;"St. Petersburg became after the end of the Iron Curtain in the early '90s, one of the main cities of the alternative scene worldwide. Groups of punks, hardcore bands and several other representatives of the alternative scene moved to the city, attracted by the large amount of young people. With the emergence of virtual communities, a few years later, it was noted the enormous potential of using these communities to combine meetings, parties, raves, etc..

	In these celebrations of St. Petersburg is always very important that each participant has at least a certain number of friends on the social network. At the same time, we want to invite as many people as possible to St. Petersburg since the restriction on the number of friends is satisfied. This constraint says that, to be invited to the party, the person must have at least one number K of friends on the guest list.

1210;Optimal Production of Great Vodka;Paradigms;6;"The production of vodka from the city of St. Petersburg is famous around the world. The legend is that the vodka produced is distributed directly into the home of some of the most senior officers of the company through the water supply system. That is, just open the tap and pours ice cold vodka (after all the pipes are running at a negative temperature most of the year) of the barrel. This causes many security problems, after all people dig the streets looking for the alleged pipes vodka leaving the 
	company.

	This is not the only problem faced in the production of vodka in town. To ensure the quality standards required of the drink, it is produced in only one still having a life well-defined M years. Maintaining varies depending on the age of the equipment. The maintenance cost is Ci, where i is the age of the distiller, and must be paid every year, even for new distillers. These stills have a price when purchased new P (age 0) and distillers used in Russian factories are played by distilleries worldwide, where they are still used for many years, and museums. 
	The selling price of a distiller with age i is Vi.

	Note that a distiller with agie M can't longer be used and must be sold. 
	Your task in this problem is deciding which moments in the company will replace the distiller to minimize 
	the cost of production at the end of N years (from year 1). Consider that the exchange of 
	stills can be done only at the 
	beginning of the year.

1211;Economic Phonebook;Data Structures and Libraries;5;"Due to the large number of complaints, the telephone company of St. Petersburg is being forced to invest heavily in improving its services. To do this, the company decided to reduce the budget of some sectors to increase other more essential. One of the sectors that will have its budget reduced is the printing of phone books.

	With a reduced budget, the sector of printing phonebooks can not buy enough toner to print the complete lists. As telephone numbers are printed vertically aligned, it was suggested the following solution: from the second phone number printed, the initial digits of the next number to be printed that match the above number are omitted, leaving only one space white. For example, for the numbers 535456, 535488, 536566 and 835456 would be printed is as follows:
	

	5 3 5 4 5 6
	        8 8
	    6 5 6 6

	Note that this impression has saved the impression 6 characters. The telephone company also wondered not print the repeated suffixes, but in tests saw that the answer was not good for the user and therefore decided to make only the elimination prefixes. To determine whether the economy will be sufficient, the printing industry wants to know the maximum number of characters that can be omitted.

Each of it six sides is covered with nine labels, each label of a color (blue, yellow, orange, white, green and red). In its initial state, all nine labels on one face have the same color. One ingenious mechanism enables each face to be independently rotated, causing the colors of the labels on the sides to be mixed.
	
	Each of the faces of the Rubik’s Cube is denoted by a letter: F, B, U, D, L, and R, as illustrated in the figure below.

	


	U F D R L B The rotation of a face is called a movement. We describe the movements using the letters that identify the faces:

	
		a capital letter represents a 90o clockwise turn of the corresponding face;
	
		a lowercase letter represents a 90o  counterclockwise turn of the corresponding face.


	
	For example, F represents a 90o clockwise turn of face F; r represents a 90o counterclockwise turn of face R. A sequence of movements is denoted by a sequence of letters identifying faces. Thus, rDF represents a 90o counterclockwise turn of face R, followed by a 90o clockwise turn of face D, followed by a 90o clockwise turn of face F.
	
	An interesting property of the Rubik’s Cube is that any sequence of movements, if applied repeat- edly, causes the cube to return to its original state (the state it had before the first application of the sequence).

Wooden posts will be placed in exactly the same spots where missing/broken concrete posts were/are. However, in order to make the temporary reconstruction faster and less expensive, the owners decided to use fewer posts: a wooden post will be used to replace a missing/broken concrete post only if the length of the barbed wired needed to close the distance to the next post (wooden or concrete) exceeds four meters.

The enemy has placed a number of security points all over his country, from which radars are detecting any moving vehicle within their range of cover. Any such detected object will be immediately destroyed. Fortunately enough, you have been given by your government a map of the enemy territory, consisting of coordinates and radius of coverage of each radar. You have also a list of local informers (together with their locations) that you should contact in order to obtain valuable information. Your mission is to try to contact one of these informers, preferably the one with highest insider-coefficient. The insider-coeficient of each informer is simply the distance from the informer to the border of the country, where such a distance is deﬁned as the minimum over all distances from the location of the informer to each point of the border. In intuitive sense, the informer with highest insider-coefficient is that who is located as inside the country as possible, and will presumably have more valuable information about the country.
    
	Your ﬁrst thought is then to design a computer program which will check if there is a path from your initial location, always the point (2000, 2000), to any of the informers’ location, without crossing any region which is covered by radar.

The informer I2, although outside the radar’s region, can’t be contacted either since any trip to his location would go through the deadly radar-covered regions.

Worried about the loss in proﬁt due to the strike, the company board proposed a new method to calculate the salaries which was luckily accepted by everyone.
	The salary of a worker reﬂects the signiﬁcance of the tasks that he/she has to perform and is inﬂuenced by the way tasks depend on each other.
    
	A task X depends on a task Y if either (i) X depends directly on Y , or (ii) there exists a task T such that X depends directly on T and T depends on Y . Since in ICPC all tasks must be performed, there is no circularity in the task dependence relation. Also, a task may be performed by more than one worker. A basic signiﬁcance is associated with each task reﬂecting its importance (for example, developing the effcient land division method is more important than building the houses themselves). The signiﬁcance of a task T is then deﬁned as the basic signiﬁcance of T plus the signiﬁcance of every task which depends directly on T. 
    Note that if no other tasks depend directly on task T, the basic signiﬁcance and the signiﬁcance of T are the same.
    
	The salary of a worker is the sum of the signiﬁcances of all the tasks he/she performs which do not depend on any other task performed by him/her.

1271;Where Are My Genes;Ad-Hoc;4;"One way that scientists try to measure how one species evolved into another is to ﬁnd out how the ancestor’s genome changed into the other’s.

                    One of the most common mutations that change the order of a genomes genes is the reversal. If we model a genome as a sequence of N genes with each gene being an integer from 1 to N, then a reversal is a mutation that changes the genome by reverting the order of a block of consecutive genes. A reversal can be described by two indexes (i, j), (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N), indicating that it reverts the order of the genes within indexes from i to j. So, when it is applied to a genome [g1, . . . , gi−1, gi , gi+1, . . . , gj−1, gj , gj+1, . . . , gN], we obtain the genome [g1, . . . , gi−1, gj , gj−1, . . . , gi+1, gi , gj+1, . . . , gN].

1274;P-Networks;Data Structures and Libraries;5;"Pretty Networks Inc. is a company that builds some curious artifacts whose purpose is to transform a set of input values in a given way. The transformation is determined by what they call a p-network. The following picture shows an example of a p-network.
                
                    
                
                    In the general case, a p-network of order N and size M, has N horizontal wires numbered 1, 2, . . . N, and M vertical strokes. Each stroke connects two consecutive wires. There are no two diﬀerent strokes touching the same point of any wire, and there is no stroke touching the leftmost or rightmost point of any wire. The above example is a p-network of order 5 and size 9.
                    
                    The transformation determined by a p-network can be explained using a set of rules that govern the way a p-network should be traversed:
                    1. start at the leftmost point of one wire, and go to the right;
                    2. each time a stroke appears move to the connected wire, and keep going from left to right;
                    3. stop when the rightmost point of one wire is reached.
                    If starting at wire i the traversing ends at wire j, we say that the p-network transforms i into j, and we denote this with i → j. In the above example the p-network determines the set of transformations
                
                    {1 → 3, 2 → 5, 3 → 4, 4 → 1, 5 → 2} .
                
                    Pretty Networks Inc. hired you to solve the following p-network design problem: given a number N and a set of transformations {1 → i1, 2 → i2, . . . N → iN}, decide if a p-network of order N can be built to accomplish them and, in this case, give one that does it.
                    When there exists a solution with a certain size, in many cases there is another solution with a greater size. Scientists at Pretty Networks Inc. have stated that if there exists a solution for a p-network design problem, then there is a solution with size less than 4N2 . Therefore, they are interested only in solutions having a size below this bound.";"The input has a certain number of p-network design problems.

The values i1, i2, . . . iN represent that the p-network should determine the set of transformations {1 → i1, 2 → i2, . . . N → iN} (1 ≤ ij ≤ N, for each 1 ≤ j ≤ N).

The value M is the size of the p-network, i.e., its number of strokes.

Each heap is moved completely to another mining point, or not moved at all. The cost of moving a heap of weight W from a mining point X to a mining point Y is W(Y - X).

Before beginning the game they arbitrarily distribute the S stones among the boxes from 1 to B -1, leaving box B empty. The game then proceeds by rounds. At each round, first Paul chooses a subset P of the stones that are in the boxes; he may choose as many stones as he wants from as many boxes as he wants, or he may choose no stones at all, in which case P is empty. Then, Carole decides what to do next: she can either promote the subset P and discard the remaining stones (that is, those stones not chosen by Paul in the first step); or she may discard the subset P and promote the remaining stones.

1284;Cellphone Typing;Strings;6;"A research team is developing a new technology to save time when typing text messages in mobile devices. They are working on a new model that has a complete keyboard, so users can type any single letter by pressing the corresponding key. In this way, a user needs P keystrokes to type a word of length P.
                
                    However, this is not fast enough. The team is going to put together a dictionary of the common words that a user may type. The goal is to reduce the average number of keystrokes needed to type words that are in the dictionary. During the typing of a word, whenever the following letter is uniquely determined, the cellphone system will input it automatically, without the need for a keystroke. To be more precise, the behavior of the cellphone system will be determined by the following rules:
                
                    1. The system never guesses the first letter of a word, so the first letter always has to be input manually by pressing the corresponding key.
                
                    2. If a non-empty succession of letters c1c2...cn has been input, and there is a letter c such that every word in the dictionary which starts with c1c2...cn also starts with c1c2...cnc, then the system inputs c automatically, without the need of a keystroke. Otherwise, the system waits for the user.
                
                    For instance, if the dictionary is composed of the words ""hello"", ""hell"", ""heaven"" and ""goodbye"", and the user presses ""h"", the system will input ""e"" automatically, because every word which starts with ""h"" also starts with ""he"". However, since there are words that start with ""hel"" and with ""hea"", the system now needs to wait for the user. If the user then presses ""l"", obtaining the partial word ""hel"", the system will input a second ""l"" automatically. When it has ""hell"" as input, the system cannot guess, because it is possible that the word is over, or it is also possible that the user may want to press ""o"" to get ""hello"". In this fashion, to type the word ""hello"" the user needs three keystrokes, ""hell"" requires two, and ""heaven"" also requires two, because when the current input is ""hea"" the system can automatically input the remainder of the word by repeatedly applying the second rule. Similarly, the word ""goodbye"" needs just one keystroke, because after pressing the initial ""g"" the system will automatically fill in the entire word. In this example, the average number of keystrokes needed to type a word in the dictionary is then (3 + 2 + 2 + 1)/4 = 2.00.

For example, if there are 22 pizzas to be delivered and Joseph determine that at most 10 of these pizzas (can be less) would be delivered by Roberto, these must necessarily be among the requests that take longer to be delivered.

The boxes are hand-made, produced individually from ﬁne materials. When accepting an order from a client, they always produce a few more boxes than needed, to keep a stock of boxes to be sold in the future, if needed. Over the years their stock has been growing, with boxes all over the place, and they decided they needed to organize it a bit more. They have therefore made a list registering the dimensions of every box in their stock.
                
                    SBC has just received an order from a client that must be delivered tomorrow, so there is no time to produce new boxes. The client wants a certain number N of boxes all of the same size; each box will be used to pack one item of dimensions X, Y and Z. As the carton used in the

If there are not at least N boxes that ﬁt perfectly, the client wants N boxes that ﬁt the items as tightly as possible. The box size that ﬁts the items as tightly as possible is the one which minimizes the empty space when the item is put inside the box.

Two cannons are placed in location A and two cannons are placed in location B. One cannon of location A is aimed towards M and the other aimed towards N. The same thing applies to the two cannons of location B. The M and N are always on the opposite side of AB.

                    The movements of the cannons, which are aimed at M, are interrelated; the angle between their directions is constant. So angle CMD ((5 degree) ≤ (angle CMD) < (80 degree)) is constant. Same rule applies to the other two cannons. That’s angle ENF ((5 degree) ≤ (angle ENF) < (80 degree)) is also constant. All these things are shown in the picture above. But another important thing is missing in the figure above is that the locations N, A, M are always kept in a straight line. The reason behind this is very strange. A robot has been hired to guard Romeo and Juliet. It has two eyes at the opposite sides of its head and this robot is positioned in point A. To be precise, A, B and angle CMD and angle ENF are constants in one scenario and all other positions or values are variable. Also remember that point M must always remain pointed by the two cannons. Same thing applies to point N.
                
                    The problem is that in starry nights Mr. Romeo sings the song “Blue Nights” of “Michael Learns to Rock” in a loud voice and both parents don’t want Ms. Juliet to hear this song.

As a member of the citizen's regulatory committee for ACM's operations, your task is to control how much the corporation can mine from those lands, so that you get to keep the jobs and other benefits without sacrificing the environment and the health of the local residents.
                
                    The ACM has plans to mine several rectangular patches of land. A patch of land has width W, can be dug up to a maximum depth D, and has a at surface which we consider to be at depth 0. The minerals in a patch are organized in three layers, which may vary in their depth along the width of the patch, but always have the same profile along its whole length. This is why the ACM is only interested in the profile along the width of each patch, and has performed exploratory work in order to precisely determine its shape.
                
                    ​As a result, they discovered that the two interfaces between the three layers of minerals can be represented by two functions y1(x) and y2(x), where the first describes the boundary between the top layer and the middle layer, and the second describes the boundary between the middle layer and the bottom layer. These functions are always such that
                
                -D < y2(x) < y1(x) < 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ W ,
                
                
                    so that the layers' boundaries never touch each other. Besides, each function has the form yi(x) = pi(x)/qi(x), where

                    The ACM will dig everything in a patch of land up to a certain digging depth d, and then sell all the minerals thus obtained to make a profit. However, the minerals in the top and the bottom layers are essentially worthless, so the profit of the whole operation comes exclusively from those minerals in the middle layer. In fact, the profit is proportional to the area A of the middle layer in the profile that is at depth at most d. Given the description of a patch of land and an integer A, you would like to know the digging depth d you should allow the ACM to dig the patch so that they get an area of minerals from the middle layer in the profile of exactly A. In the figure above you can see the answer for the two test cases in the sample input. For the patch on the left, in order to get an area A = 14 the digging depth must be d = 4.00000, while for the patch on the right an area A = 14 requires a digging depth d = 5.51389.";Each test case is described using 5 lines. The first line contains four integers W, D, A and K, where W is the width of the patch of land the ACM wants to mine (1 ≤ W ≤ 8), D is its depth (1 ≤ D ≤ 10), A is the area of the middle layer in the profile that the ACM must get (1 ≤ A ≤ W x D), and K allows the definition of the interfaces y1(x) and y2(x) as explained above (0 ≤ K ≤ 8). Each of the other lines contains K + 1 integers between -108 and 108, inclusive. The second line contains the coeffificients of p1(x) from P1,0 to P1,K.

The fifth line contains the coeficients of q2(x) from Q2,0 to Q2,K. Within each test case A is strictly less than the total area of the middle layer in the profile, and there exists a single value d such that a digging depth d yields an area of minerals from the middle layer in the profile of exactly A. Besides, q1(x) 6= 0, q2(x) 6= 0 and -D < y2(x) < y1(x) < 0, for 0 ≤ x ≤ W.;For each test case output a line with a rational number representing the depth d that the ACM should be allowed to dig the patch of land so that they get an area of minerals from the middle layer in the profile of exactly A.

                    There was invented a new powerfull gadget by the International Beautifull Machines corporation called the love machine! Given a string made of binary digits, the love machine answers if it's made only of love, that is, if all you need is love to build that string. The definition of love for the love machine is another string of binary digits, given by a human operator. Let's say we have a string L which represents ""love"" and we give a string S for the love machine. We say that all you need is love to build S, if we can repeatly subtract L from S until we reach L. The subtraction defined here is the same arithmetic subtraction in base 2. By this definition it's easy to see that if L > S (in binary), then S is not made of love. If S = L then S is obvious made of love.
                
                    Let's see an example. Supose S = ""11011"" and L = ""11"". If we reapetly subtract L from S, we get: 11011, 11000, 10101, 10010, 1111, 1100, 1001, 110, 11. So, given this L, all you need is love to build S. Because of some limitations of the love machine, there can be no string with leading zeroes. That is, ""0010101"", ""01110101"", ""011111"" etc. are invalid strings. Strings which have only one digit are also invalid (it's another limitation).

1317;I Hate SPAM, But Some People Love It;Graph;6;"Nowadays, unfortunately, SPAM messages are becoming more and more common. Some of them may have a multiplicative effect since they ask you to forward them to all your friends. Some SPAM messages wish good luck, others promise you will become rich, and others just remind you how important it is to tell your friends that you care for their friendship. Here is an example of a SPAM:

                
                       From: Alice 
                        To: Bob, Mary, Julia, Paul
                        Hi, this is a good luck email. I wish you become a millionaire, but
                       that is up to you. If you: 
                        * send this email to 10 or more people you will be a millionaire
                        * send this email to 5 or more people you will be rich
                        * send this email to less than 5 people you will be poor
                        As I said, it is up to you. Write your email and be rich! :-)
                        Alice
                

                
                    People usually react in two different ways when they receive a SPAM:
                
                    They discard the message immediately without even reading it (they hate SPAM);
                    They forward the message to everyone they know (they love SPAM).
                
                
                    For this problem, we will assume everyone loves SPAM, but one never forwards the same message twice. Each SPAM message has a different effect based on the number of friends you forward the message to. For example: a SPAM message could tell that you will be poor if you send the message to 5 friends, but you will be the rich if you send to 10, and you will be the richest man in the world if you send it to 20 friends, and so on. 
                    We will consider only SPAM messages similar to the example above. More speciﬁcally, a SPAM message will deﬁne two threshold values T1  and T2  and three attributes A1, A2  and A3. A person acquires one of the three attributes depending on the number of messages forwarded for that speciﬁc SPAM. If a person forwards T messages and T < T1  then her/his attribute is A1, if T1 ≤ T < T2  then her/his attribute is A2, otherwise her/his attribute is A3.

You have to write a program that determines, for each person in the given group, which attributes she/he acquired, based on all the SPAM they forward.

The user is then teletransported to the station which is at the same distance from the teletransporter as the start station, but on the opposite side relative to the teletransporter. More precisely, if the location of the start station is i and the user presses the key corresponding to the teletransporter located in position j, he will be taken to the station located at position 2 x j - i. For example, if the user is in station 6 and wants to go to station -2, he can use the teletransporter C (goes from 6 to 10) and then the teletransporter A (goes from 10 to -2).

                    r = At + B

                
                    θ = Ct + D

                
                    in order to determine the trajectory of the particle, in polar coordinates. The radius (r) is represented in distance units and the angle (θ) in degrees. The time (t) is given in time units and it is always a rational value which can be represented by an irreducible fraction. Your granddaughter knows that in polar coordinates a point has infinite representations. In general, the point (r, θ) can be represented as (r, θ ± k x360°) or ( -r, θ ±(2k + 1) ×180°), where k is any integer. Besides, the origin (r = 0) can be represented as (0, θ) for any θ.

                
                    Using these parameters informed by each particle accelerator, your granddaughter wants to determine whether the particles will eventually collide and, if they do, the time when they will collide. After the first collision it is impossible to predict the particle's trajectory, therefore, only the first possible collision should be considered.

                
                    Although your granddaughter is really intelligent and has a deep knowledge of particle physics, she does not know how to program computers and is looking for some notes in her grandfather's (or grandmother's) ICPC notebook (don't forget, she is your granddaughter!).

The end of the input is represented by A1 = B1 = C1 = D1 = A2 = B2 = C2 = D2 = 0, which should not be processed as a test case, since these are the values displayed by the particle accelerators when a big black hole would be created if the particles were trown.

1325;Bubble Maps;Paradigms;4;"Bubble Inc. is developing a new technology for browsing a map at different zoom levels. Their new technology assumes that the region to be mapped is a rectangular plane surface and it divides this surface in rectangular sub-regions, which represent deeper zoom levels. Bubble Inc. technology represents maps using a structure known as quad-tree. In a quad-tree, a rectangular region named x may be divided in half, both horizontally and vertically, resulting in four equal-sized rectangular sub-regions. Those sub-regions are called child regions of x, and are named xp for the top-left, xq for the top-right, xr for the bottom-right and xs for the bottom-left regions, where xc represents the concatenation of string x and character c = ‘p’, ‘q’, ‘r’ or ‘s’. For example, if the base region to be mapped is called m, the child regions of m are, from top-left in clockwise order: mp, mq, mr and ms, as illustrated below.

                ​

                
                    Any region can be further subdivided. For example, the region named ms can be further divided into sub-regions msp, msq, msr and mss, as illustrated below.

                

                
                    As another example, the figure below shows the result of subdividing the child sub-regions of the region named msr.

                ​

                
                    Sub-regions with names of the same length have the same zoom level, since they represent regions of the same size. Sub-regions in the same zoom level that share a common side are said to be neighbors. Anything that lies outside the base region m is not mapped and, for every zoom level, all sub-regions of m are mapped. Bubble’s map technology provides a way for the user to navigate from a given sub-region to neighboring sub-regions in the directions up, down, left and right. You mission is to help Bubble Inc. in finding the neighboring sub-regions of a given sub-region.

1326;Chemistry;Data Structures and Libraries;7;"International Chemical Products Company (ICPC) is a company known world-wide for its good and affordable products, which include shampoos, cleaning products, bug-killing products, and even some types of vaccines. The ICPC engineers are always researching new ways of reducing their products’ manufacturing costs, without lowering their quality.
                
                    One of their engineers, Mr. Poucher, has a new idea to reduce the cost, which aims at reducing the number of containers necessary to hold the substances during the sequence of chemical reactions to obtain a final substance. These final substances are obtained through a sequence of reactions of the form X + Y → Z, where X and Y are either initial substances or intermediate substances that were already generated from previous reactions. These reactions are done inside a reaction container, which once emptied can be cleaned up and used again. The process for generating a final substance can be described via a sequence of two simple operations:
                
                    Put an available substance in an empty reaction container C;
                    Perform the reaction X + Y → Z either by putting X in the reaction container holding Y, or by putting Y in the reaction container containing X. The order does not affect the end result of the reaction.
                
                
                    What Mr. Poucher noticed was that by choosing smartly the sequence of reaction, ICPC could drastically cut out on the number of reaction containers needed in the company. For example, consider the following sequence of chemical reactions used to obtain final substance P:
                
                    1) A + B -> T1
                    2) C + D -> T2
                    3) E + F -> T3
                    4) T2 + T3 -> T4
                    5) T4 + T1 -> P
                
                    In this example, A, B, C, D, E, and F are the initial substances (only appear on the left side of reactions), T1, T2, T3 and T4 are the intermediate substances (appear on the left side of at least one reaction, and exactly once on right side of some other reaction) and P is the final substance (only appears on the right side of a single reaction, which will be the last one listed).
                    If the sequence of reactions is performed as given then three reaction containers are necessary in order to produce the final substance P:
                
                    Containers
                    Operations C1 C2 C3
                
                    put A in C1: A - -
                    add B to C1: T1 - -
                    put C in C2: T1 C -
                    add D to C2: T1 T2 -
                    put E in C3: T1 T2 E
                    add F to C3: T1 T2 T3
                    put T2 in C3: T1 - T4
                    put T4 in C1: P - -
                
                    Note, however, that if the reactions are performed in the sequence 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, two reaction containers are sufficient:
                
                    Containers
                    Operations C1 C2
                
                    put C in C1: C
                    add D to C1: T2
                    put E in C2: T2 E
                    add F to C2: T2 T3
                    put T2 in C2: - T4
                    put A in C1: A T4
                    add B to C1: T1 T4

                    You have been hired by ICPC, and your task is to create a computer program to determine the minimum number of reaction containers necessary to perform the sequence of reactions needed to obtain the final substance.
                
                    You should assume that:
                
                    The reaction producing the final substance is the last listed, and the reaction producing an intermediate substance will always precede reactions where that intermediate substance is used.
                    A sequence of reactions producing the final substance is always possible.
                    ICPC has an unlimited supply of initial substances.
                    At the beginning of the production process, each initial substance is in a storage container, used to hold all ICPC stock of this substance. Such containers cannot be used as reaction container to hold intermediate products of reactions.
                    All the reaction containers are large enough to hold all the resulting substances.
                    The amount of substance generated by a single reaction is just enough to be used as input to a single other reaction. For instance, if an intermediate product Z is necessary as input for two different reaction, this product must be produced twice.

1328;Go Easy;Graph;7;"The mayor of a city wants to introduce a new transport system to simplify the life of its inhabitants. That will be done via the use of a debit card, which the mayor named “GoEasy”. There are two means of transportation in the city: trains and buses. The train system is “zone based” whereas the bus system is “journey based”. The fare for a journey is computed as follows:

                
                    There is an initial two money units fare for entering the transport system, regardless of the initial means of transportation.
                    When travelling by train a customer pays four money units for each change of zone.
                    When travelling by bus a customer pays one money unit each time she/he boards a bus.
                

                
                    A transport system map will provide information about the stations belonging to each zone, and the sequence of stations for each bus and train itinerary. Buses and trains move in both directions in each itinerary, and no train or bus goes through the same station twice during a single trip through an itinerary. It is always possible to go from any station to any other station using trains and/or buses. The rules for computing fares are strict: if during a train journey a customer enters a given zone twice, she/he is charged twice; similarly, if during a bus journey a customer boards twice the bus for the same itinerary, she/he is charged twice.

                    In the transport map above a customer can travel from station 2 to station 4 paying just two money units, by using line T1, since they are in the same zone. But if the customer needs to go from station 2 to 5, then the best is to take the bus B3 to station 10 and then take the bus B2 to station 5, paying in total four money units. Rather than tracking the whole trip of each passenger, the idea of the mayor is that machines will be placed in all stations, and travellers are supposed to swipe their personal GoEasy travel card only when starting AND finishing the whole journey. Since all the machines are interconnected into a network, based on the departure and arrival stations the system can compute the minimum cost possible for the trip, and that amount is charged from the traveller’s debit card. All that is missing is a computer system for doing the calculations for the fare to be deducted.

1334;Electrical Pollution;Graph;9;"Sortonia is the capital of the North Nlogonia province. The city is laid out with almost all of its streets in a square grid, aligned to either the North-South or the West-East direction. The only exception is Merge Avenue, which runs Southwest-Northeast, splitting city blocks along their diagonals.

                
                    Sortonia is also one of the greenest cities in Nlogonia. The local university developed technology to harness the magnetic field of Earth for energy generation. As a consequence, all intersections of Merge Avenue have power generators installed, supplying all the homes and businesses of the city.

                
                    This technology was praised by environmentalists at the time for eliminating Sortonia's carbon footprint, but soon after its introduction, thousands of bees and birds were found dead in the city. Puzzled, the Queen of Nlogonia ordered the queendom's biophysicists to investigate the phenomenon.

                
                    After many months of study, they discovered that the generators used by Sortonians created anomalies in the local magnetic field. The birds and bees that use the Earth's magnetic field to guide their flight were confused by these anomalies, started flying in circles and eventually died of exhaustion.

                
                    According to the biophysicists' theoretical models, each generator creates an anomaly that is represented as an integer value. Each anomaly propagates indefinitely in all four compass directions. Points that are not directly north, south, west or east of the generator are unaffected by it. On the other hand, if a point is aligned with two generators then the anomaly at that point is the sum of the two anomalies produced by those generators. As an example, consider the picture below that represents a certain portion of Sortonia. The anomaly at point R is just the one produced by the generator at that point, while the anomaly at point T is the sum of the anomalies produced by the generator at point R and the generator at point S.

                ​​

                
                    The biophysicists would like to measure the anomalies for some city intersections, but these measurements require expensive equipment and technical expertise. So they plan to measure only a subset of the city's intersections and extrapolate other data from them. Predicting an anomaly from a set of measurements might require combining several of them in complicated ways. Thus, the Queen ordered you to write a program that predicts the anomalies at certain intersections, given the measurements previously made.";"Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains two integers M and Q representing respectively the number of measurements and the number of queries (1 ≤ M, Q ≤ 104).

1336;Garden Fence;Computational Geometry;8;"Gary is a careful gardener that has a rectangular field full of trees. There are two kinds of trees in his land: pines and larches. To improve their vitality, he decided to start using a specific fertilizer for each kind of tree, instead of the generic fertilizer he was using so far.

                
                    Since Gary has many trees, fertilizers cannot be placed individually on each tree. For this reason he decided to build a fence to separate the field in two, and use the pine fertilizer on one side and the larch fertilizer on the other side. The new fence will be built over a straight line connecting two distinct points located on the boundary of the land.

                
                    Sadly, each fertilizer is great for the kind of tree it is intended, but deadly for the other. After building the fence and deciding which fertilizer will be used on each side, larches in pines' side and pines in larches' side will be cut down, to prevent a slow death that will ruin the landscape. Furthermore, before building the fence it is necessary to cut down trees of any kind lying directly over the line where the fence will be located.

                
                    Of course, Gary loves his trees. Depending on their kind, age and other factors, each tree has a certain value. The gardener wants to build the fence and select where to use each fertilizer in such a way that his loss is minimized, where the loss is the sum of the values of the trees that will be cut down.

The name of the game comes from the fact that in King's Poker, the King is the highest ranked card. But this is not the only difference between regular Poker and King's Poker. Players of King's Poker are dealt a hand of just three cards. There are three types of hands:

                    A pair, which contains two cards of the same rank, with the other card unmatched.
                    A no-pair, where no two cards have the same rank.
                

                
                    Hands are ranked using the following rules:

                
                    Any set defeats any pair and any no-pair.
                    Any pair defeats any no-pair.

                    If the matched cards of two pairs have the same rank, then the unmatched card of both hands are compared; the pair with the higher ranked unmatched card defeats the pair with the lower ranked unmatched card, unless both unmatched cards have the same rank, in which case there is a tie.

1338;It-Miha;Mathematics;8;"In Ancient Egypt, the building of the pyramids is surrounded in mystery. Many researchers consider that the technology needed to build them wasn't available at the time, and suspect that the egyptians had extraterrestrial help to build them. An example of those mysteries are the ""It-miha"" numbers. In the egyptian province of It-miha, a rock with an inscripted sequence of numbers was found. Apparently the numbers had no connection to each other, until Poincaré, at the end of the 19th century, conjectured that the recorded numbers were the first 500 square-free integers. A perfect square is an integer with an integer square root, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. We say that an integer is square-free if it isn't divisible by any perfect square greater than 1. It may sound simple to us today to determine those numbers, but over 3500 years ago, with a different numbering system, the calculations were very difficult to perform.

At the beginning of the game each player is assigned a piece; all pieces are initially positioned right before the first square of the trail.

                
                    The game proceeds in rounds. At each round, players rolls a pair of dice, and move their pieces forward a number of squares equal to the rolled result. Players roll the dice always in the same order (player A, then player B, etc.) in the rounds.

                
                    Most of the squares on the board are plain squares, but some are “traps”. If a player’s piece falls on a trap square at the end of the player’s move, the player misses the next round. That is, he/she does not roll the dice, and his/her piece stays one round without moving.

Consider, for example, the board in the figure above, which has squares numbered from 1 to 48. At the start, the pieces are positioned at the place marked ‘Begin’ in the figure, that is, before the square number 1. Therefore, if a player rolls a 7 (dice showing 2 and 5 for example), his/her piece is positioned at square number 7 at the end of the first round of the game. Furthermore, if a player’s piece is positioned at square 41, the player needs a roll result of at least 8 to reach the end of the trail and win the game.

                    Pawns' moves are a bit different from chess, since they can only move one square forward, and all of them move at the same time. They never move on a diagonal. Squares of the board are numbered from 1 to 64, as shown above. Pawns move in vertical direction from top to bottom, so that squares numbered 57 to 64 are the pawns' goal.

                
                    Each round of the game is composed by one move of the horse followed by a simultaneous move of all pawns not yet captured.

                
                    In order to capture a pawn, the player has to move the horse to a square where a pawn is. A captured pawn leaves the board, and only the remaining ones will move ahead in the next round. To win the game, the player has to capture all pawns. If a pawn gets to the last row, it becomes a king. Then the horse has only one more move to capture it. If it doesn’t, the king moves and it means that the game is over and the player loses. Moreover, if the horse moves to a square that will be occupied by a pawn at the next move of the pawns, the horse is captured by the pawn and the player loses.

                
                    Your task is to write a program that analysis a ""Runner Pawns"" diagram and answer whether there is a sequence of movements for the horse to win. If it is possible, your program should determine the minimum number of moves needed by the horse to capture all pawns.";The input contains several instances of the problem, one per line. Each instance starts with an integer P representing the number of pawns (0 ≤ P ≤ 8), followed by P integers (1 ≤ A1, A2, ...

The end of input is indicated by a line containing P = 0.;For each instance of the problem in the input your program must print a single line, containing the answer to the problem. If there is a sequence of moves for the horse to capture all pawns before a surviving king moves (and without the horse being captured by a pawn) then the program should print the length of the minimum sequence of moves that make it possible. Otherwise your program should print the word ‘impossible’.;True;6 / 10;126;64;50.79%

Besides working on political aspects, such as lobbying governments to join the Intenational Campaign to Ban Landmines, MNA also works on disarming mines left by past wars.

                
                    Nowadays, mines are detected by satellites or surveillance airplanes. But to disarm a mine you have to get close to it. In most cases, the only way to reach a mined field is by helicopter. To clear the field, you must find the most secure region within the field so that the helicopter can land on it. This region is a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, with no mines inside and whose smaller side is the largest possible. More precisely, let A and B be the length of the sides of all possible rectangles that do not contain any mines and A <= B; the most secure region is a rectangle with the largest value of A and the largest value of B. That is, among all rectangles that do not contain any mines and whose smaller side is A (largest possible), the most secure region is a rectangle that has the largest B.

1346;Child Play;Mathematics;10;"Natives from the tiny island of Tookutoo are keen on mathematics, and teach their children to play several math-oriented games. A popular puzzle in Tookutoo is played with ceramic slabs like the ones shown in the figure below.

                

                
                    As it can be seen in the figure above, slabs are similar to dominoes, being divided in two parts; in each
                    part an integer value is imprinted. The slabs above have values [2, 1], [6, 3] and [3, 1]. Note that a slab
                    [a, b] can also be written as [b, a].

                    one slab can be discarded while leaving the same sum, the player must discard the slab [a, b] such that
                    a ≤ b and a is the least possible value considering all possible slabs to be discarded.

Differently from earthquakes in Earth, marsquakes are not unusual on Mars. This one, however, caused the mine to start sinking slowly into the soil. The mine has a rectangular external shape, and its interior is like a maze, with high, straight walls and, most importantly, teleporters. Teleporters, as you know, can transport people instantly from one place to another. Teleporters in the mine are old models, using ancient technology, and can only teleport people if there is a clear view from one teleporter booth to another (that is, if there are no obstacles or walls in between the booths).

                    A scanner will produce an image of the token introduced by the client and a computer program will validate it. In the scanner image, metal appears as dark pixels (values near 0) and holes appear as light pixels (values near 255). There are two problems that must be solved in the validations process. The first problem is that, since the token is square, a client can introduce it in the machine slot in several possible ways. The second problem is due to the poor quality of the image generated by those cheap scanners, which will contain “noise” (errors). To validate the token, the machine will compare the scanner output to a “standard image” of the token, previously produced using a high quality scanner.

1356;Jupiter Attacks!;Data Structures and Libraries;7;"Jupiter is invading! Major cities have been destroyed by Jovian spacecrafts and humanity is fighting back. Nlogonia is spearheading the counter-offensive, by hacking into the spacecrafts’ control system.

                
                    Unlike Earthling computers, in which usually a byte has 28 possible values, Jovian computers use bytes with B possible values, {0,1,...,B−1}. Nlogonian software engineers have reverse-engineered the firmware for the Jovian spacecrafts, and plan to sabotage it so that the ships eventually selfdestruct.

                
                    As a security measure, however, the Jovian spacecrafts run a supervisory program that periodically checks the integrity of the firmware, by hashing portions of it and comparing the result against known good values. To hash the portion of the firmware from the byte at position i to the byte at position j, the supervisor uses the hash function

                
                    ​
                

                where P is a prime number. For instance, if B = 20 and P = 139, while bytes 2 to 5 of the firmware have the values f2 = 14, f3 = 2, f4 = 2 and f5 = 4 then

                
                    H(f2, . . . f5) = B0 f5 + B1 f4 + B2 f3 + B3 f2 (mod P)
                                                         = 200 × 4 + 201 × 2 + 202 × 2 + 203 × 14 (mod 139)
					               = 4 + 40 + 800 + 112000 (mod 139)

                    The Nlogonian cryptologists need to find a way to sabotage the firmware without tripping the supervisor. As a first step, you have been assigned to write a program to simulate the interleaving of two types of commands: editing bytes of the firmware by the Nlogonian software engineers, and computing hashes of portions of the firmware by the Jovian supervisory program. At the beginning of the simulation the value of every byte in the firmware is zero.";"Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains four integers B, P, L and N, where B is the number of possible values of a Jovian byte, P is the modulus of the Jovian hash (2 ≤ B < P ≤ 109 and P prime), L is the length (number of Jovian bytes) of the spacecrafts’ firmware, and N is the number of commands to simulate (1 ≤ L, N ≤ 105). At the beginning of the simulation the value of every byte in the firmware is fi = 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ L. Each of the next N lines describes a command to simulate. Each command description starts with an uppercase letter that is either ‘E’ or ‘H’, with the following meanings.

                
                    'E': The line describes an edit command. The letter is followed by two integers I and V indicating that the byte at position I of the firmware (that is, fI ) must receive the value V (1 ≤ I ≤ L and 0 ≤ V ≤ B − 1).
                    'H': The line describes a hash command. The letter is followed by two integers I and J indicating that H(fI, . . . fJ ) must be computed (1 ≤ I ≤ J ≤ L).

                    Uncle Jeff normally operates as follows. He ﬁrst collects various orders for small rectangular glass panes, for windows or picture frames. He then marks the position of each small rectangular pane onto a big rectangular glass pane, such that no two marked rectangles overlap. Finally, he performs a sequence of horizontal and vertical cuts, always from edge to edge of the pane being cut, so as to produce glass panes for all the customers.

He wants a program which given a big rectangular glass pane and lower-left and upper-right coordinates of each marked rectangle determines the order in which the edge-to-edge cuts can be performed. This list of cuts will be fed into a machine which will do the boring cuts for him!";"The input contains several test cases. The ﬁrst line of a test case contains an integer N indicating the number of windows and picture frames in the test (2 ≤ N ≤ 2000). Each of the next N lines contains four integers X1, Y1, X2, Y2, where (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) represent the lower-left and upper-right coordinates marked by uncle Jeff on the big glass pane (−5000 ≤ X1, Y1, X2, Y2 ≤ 5000; X1 < X2 and Y1 < Y2).

1359;Land Division Tax;Ad-Hoc;9;"International Concrete Projects Company (ICPC) is a construction company which specializes in building houses for the high-end Market. ICPC is planning a housing development for new homes around a lake. The houses will be built in lots of different sizes, but all lots will be on the lake shore. Additionally, every lot will have exactly two neighbors in the housing development: one to the left and one to the right.

                
                    

                
                    ICPC owns the land around the lake and needs to divide it into lots according to the housing development plan. However, the County Council has a curious regulation regarding land tax, intended to discourage the creation of small lots:

                
                    land can only be divided using a sequence of land divisions;
                    a land division is an operation that divides one piece of land into two pieces of land; and
                    for each land division, a land division tax must be paid.
                

                
                    Denoting by A the area of the largest resulting part of the division, the value of the land division tax is A x F, where F is the division tax factor set yearly by the County Council. Note that due to (2), in order to divide a piece of land into N lots, N – 1 land divisions must be performed, and therefore N – 1 payments must be made to the County Council.

                
                    For example, considering the figure above, if the division tax factor is 2.5 and the first land division separates the lot of 500 units of area from the other lots, the land division tax to be paid for this first division is 2.5 x (300 + 200 + 100 + 100 + 100). If the next land division separates the lot of 300 units together with its neighbor lot of 100 units, from the set of remaining lots, an additional 2.5 x (300 + 100) must be paid in taxes, and so on. Note also that some land divisions are not possible, due to (2). For example, after the first land division mentioned above, it is not possible to make a land division to separate the lot of 300 units together with the lot of 200 units from the remaining three lots, because more than two parts would result from that operation.

                
                    Given the areas of all lots around the lake and the current value of the division tax factor, you must write a program to determine the smallest total land division tax that should be paid to divide the land according to the housing development plan.";"The input contains several test cases.

1360;Magic Trick;Ad-Hoc;5;"A magician invented a new card trick and presented it in the prestigious American Conference of Magicians (ACM). The trick was so nice it received the 'Best Magic Award' at the conference. The trick requires three participants: the magician himself, a spectator and an assistant. During the trick the spectator is asked to shuffle a deck of 52 cards and pick randomly 5 cards out of the deck. The five cards are given to the  assistant (without the magician seeing the cards) who looks at them and shows four of the five cards one by one to the magician. After seeing the four cards the magician magically guesses the missing fifth card! The trick works because once the assistant has the five cards he can always choose four of them and use those to ‘code’ information about the fifth one. The code is based on an ordering of the cards. Cards are  ordered first by their suits and then by their face value. We will use the following order:
                
                    H < C < D < S (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades) for suits; and
                    1 < 2 < ... < 9 < T < J < Q < K for face values, where T, J, Q and K stand for Ten, Jack, Queen and King, respectively.
                
                
                    Assume the spectator chose the cards JD, 8S, 7H, 8C, QH (Jack of Diamonds, 8 of Spades, 7 of Hearts, 8 of Clubs and Queen of Hearts). The strategy for the assistant is the following:
                
                    Find a suit s which appears at least twice in the set of chosen cards (Hearts in the example). If more than one suit appears two times, choose the one with lowest order.
                    Hide the card x with suit s that is at most six positions ahead in the cyclic order 1 < 2 < ... < T < J < Q < K < 1 < 2 < ... of another card y of the same suit. That is always possible since there are only thirteen cards with the same suit (in the example the assistant hides QH). If two or more cards satisfy the criteria above, choose the one with the smallest face value.
                    Show y to the magician. At this point the magician knows the suit of the hidden card, and also knows that the face value of the hidden card x is at most six positions in front of the face value of y.
                    With the three cards the assistant has left, he must code a number between 1 and 6. That can be done as follows. Say the three cards z1, z2, z3 are in the order z1 < z2 < z3.
                
                
                    Each of six possible orders in which these three cards can be shown may be interpreted to convey information about a number.
                
                    – z1, z2, z3 means 1,
                    – z1, z3, z2 means 2,
                    – z2, z1, z3 means 3,
                    – z2, z3, z1 means 4,
                    – z3, z1, z2 means 5,
                    – z3, z2, z1 means 6.
                
                    In this way, once the magician is shown the four cards one by one, he has enough information to “magically” guess the fifth one!

1363;Car Plates Competition;Ad-Hoc;8;"Martin and Isa are very competitive. The newest competition they have created is about looking
                    at the plates of the cars. Each time one of them sees a car plate on the streets, he or she sends
                    to the other an SMS message with the content of that plate; the one who has seen the newest
                    plate is in the lead of the game. As the Automobile Car Management (ACM) office assigns the
                    plates sequentially in increasing order, they can compare them and find out who is the winner.
                
                    Martin has a very smart eye and he has stayed on the lead for several weeks. Maybe he keeps
                    looking at the streets instead of working, or maybe he stays all day in front of the car selling
                    companies waiting for new cars to go out with new plates. Isa, tired of being always behind,
                    has written a program that generates a random plate, so the next time Martin sends a message
                    to her, she will respond with this generated plate. In this way, she hopes to give Martin a hard
                    time trying to beat her.
                
                    However, Martin has grown suspicious, and he wants to determine if Isa actually saw a car with
                    the plate she sent or not. This way, he will know if Isa is in the lead of the game.
                
                    He knows some facts about the plates assigned by the ACM:
                
                    Each plate is a combination of 7 characters, which may be uppercase letters (A-Z), or
                        digits (0-9).
                    There exists two kinds of plate schemes: the old one, used for several years, and the new
                        one which has been in use for some months, when the combinations of the old one were
                        exhausted.
                    In the old scheme, the first three characters were letters, and the last four were digits, so
                        the plates run from AAA0000 to ZZZ9999.
                    In the new scheme, the first five characters are letters, and the last two are digits. Unfortunately
                        the chief of ACM messed up with the printing system while he was trying
                        to create a poster for his next campaign for mayor, and the printer is not able to write
                        the letters A, C, M, I, and P. Therefore, in this new scheme, the first plate is BBBBB00,
                        instead of AAAAA00.
                    The plates are assigned following a sequential order. As a particular case, the last plate
                        from the old scheme is followed by the first plate from the new scheme.
                
                
                    As Isa is not aware of all of this, she has just made sure that her random generator creates a
                    combination consisting of seven characters, where the first three characters are always uppercase
                    letters, the last two characters are always digits, and each one of the fourth and fifth characters
                    may be an uppercase letter or a digit (possibly generating an illegal combination, but she has
                    not much time to worry about that).
                
                    Of course, Martin will not consider Isa the winner if he receives an illegal combination, or if he
                    receives a legal plate, but equal to or older than his. But that’s not all of it. Since Martin knows
                    that new plates are not generated too fast, he will not believe that Isa saw a car with a plate
                    newer than the one he sent, but sequentially too far. For example, if Martin sends DDDDD45,
                    and receives ZZZZZ45, he will not believe that Isa saw a car with that plate, because he knows
                    that the ACM couldn’t have printed enough plates to get to ZZZZZ45 in the time he received
                    that answer.
                
                    So, Martin has decided to consider Isa the winner only if he receives a legal plate, newer than
                    his, and older than or equal to the C-th consecutive plate after the one he sent. He calls C his
                    confidence number. For example, if Martin sends ABC1234, and his confidence number is 6, he

If more than one free block are equally appropriate, choose the closest to the beginning of the disk. Whether it’s not possible to insert the file by lack of a free big enough block, it must automatically execute the otimiza operation.  If after the optimization it still not possible to inset the file, an error message must be produced. If all the operations were executed without errors, your program must produce one approximated estimative of the disk final stage, as described below.

Subsequence x is a segment of w if ij+1 = ij + 1, for j = 1, 2, ..., s-1. For example the word ove is a segment of the word lovely, whereas the word loly is a subsequence of lovely, but not a segment.

                
                    A word is a common subsequence of two words w1 and w2 if it is a subsequence of each of the two words.

The number of the first car in the grid is displayed at the top of the pole, the number of the car in second place is shown below that, and so on.

                During the race, the pole is used to display the current position of each car: the car that is winning the race has its number displayed at the top of the pole, followed by the car that is in second place, and so on.

                Besides showing the current position of a car, the pole is also used to display the number of positions the cars have won or lost, relative to the starting grid. This is done by showing, side by side to the car number, an integer number. A positive value v beside a car number in the pole means that car has won v positions relative to the starting grid. A negative value v means that car has lost v positions relative to the starting grid. A zero beside a car number in the pole means the car has neither won nor lost any positions relative to the starting grid (the car is in the same position it started).

1376;Brothers;Mathematics;7;"In the land of ACM ruled a great King who became obsessed with order. The kingdom had a rectangular form, and the King divided the territory into a grid of small rectangular counties. Before dying, the King distributed the counties among his sons.

                However, he was unaware that his children had developed a strange rivalry: the first heir hated the second heir, but not the rest; the second heir hated the third heir, but not the rest, and so on . . . Finally, the last heir hated the first heir, but not the other heirs.

                As soon as the King died, the strange rivalry among the King’s sons sparked off a generalized war in the kingdom. Attacks only took place between pairs of adjacent counties (adjacent counties are those that share one vertical or horizontal border). A county X attacked an adjacent county Y whenever the owner of X hated the owner of Y . The attacked county was always conquered by the attacking brother. By a rule of honor all the attacks were carried out simultaneously, and a set of simultaneous attacks was called a battle. After a certain number of battles, the surviving sons made a truce and never battled again. For example, if the King had three sons, named 0, 1 and 2, the figure below shows what happens in the first battle for a given initial land distribution:

Recently, the hard disk table was corrupted, so the organization of all the files was lost. Sadly enough, there are no backups of that information. The only hope is to look through the entire disk data and try to find out which parts correspond to each file. Fortunately, the disk was using a file system that kept each individual file contiguous, so only contiguous pieces of data need to be inspected.

Moreover, for each repetition of the same contiguous bytes, only one copy needs to be checked. For instance, if the data is ‘ababcabb’, the contiguous subsequences ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘ab’ are repeated, but nothing containing ‘c’, nor ‘ba’ or ‘bb’ is.

1386;Ambiguous Codes;Strings;10;"An extensive area of research in computer science is the field of communications. With computer networks being part of everyday life of many people, the development of ways for making networks faster, more reliable and secure is constantly needed. This practical needs to motivate an extensive research activity in the theory behind communications.

                The first thing needed to establish any kind of communication is a common code. A code is a way of changing the form of a piece of information into some other form, in general to make it possible to convey that piece of information from one place to another. Flag codes used by boats and the Morse code used in telegraphy are examples of codes for translating letters into different forms to enable communication over different media.

                More formally, a code is a set of strings composed of symbols from one alphabet. Each string defined in the code is called a code word. A message is then composed concatenating a set of code words to convey the information needed. For example, in Morse code the alphabet is composed of the symbols hyphen and dot; letter “S” is represented by the code word “...”, letter “O” is represented by the code word “---”, and therefore the distress message “SOS” in Morse code is “...---...”.

                Codes for communication can have many desirable and undesirable properties such as ambiguity, entropy, redundancy, and many more. In this problem we will focus on ambiguity as a key property.

                A code is ambiguous when there exists a message using that code that can be partitioned into different sequences of code words. In other words, in an ambiguous code a message may have more than one meaning. For example, consider the binary alphabet, composed of symbols {0,1}. For the code composed of the words {10, 01, 101} the message 10101 can be understood as 10-101 or 101-01 and therefore the code is ambiguous. On the other hand, for the code composed of the words {01, 10, 011} no ambiguous message exists and therefore the code is unambiguous.

                As a part of the computer science community, you are required to develop a tester that checks if codes are ambiguous. In case a code is indeed ambiguous, you are also required to report the length (i.e. the number of symbols) of the shortest ambiguous message for that code.";"Each test case will consist on several lines.

1388;Where Are The Bubbles?;Data Structures and Libraries;10;"One of the most frequent operations in computation is to sort a sequence of objects. So it is not surprising that this operation is also one of the most studied.

                A simple algorithm for sorting is called Bubblesort. It consists of several turns. At each turn the algorithm simply iterates over the sequence switching sides two consecutive elements if they are out of order. The algorithm terminates when no element shifted in one turn.

                The name Bubblesort (sort of bubbles) derives from the fact that smaller elements (""lighter elements"") move toward their final positions in the sorted sequence (move toward the beginning of the sequence) during shifts, like air bubbles in water. The figure below shows an implementation of the algorithm in pseudocode:
				
                For i from 1 to N do 
				  For j from N - 1 to i do
				    If seq [j - 1]> seq [j] then
				      Interchange elements seq [j - 1], and seq [j]
                    End-If
                  End-For
                  If no element switched places
                    End of algorithm
                  End-If
                End-For

                For example, to sort the sequence [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] using the above algorithm, four shifts are required. In the first round four exchanges occur: 1 x 2, 1 x 3, 1 x 4 and 1 x 5, in the second part there are three exchanges 2 x 3, 2 x 4 and 2 x 5, in the third round two exchanges occur: 3 x 4 and 3 x 5; in the fourth shift there is only one exchange: 4 x 5, in the fifth round no exchange occurs and the algorithm terminates.

                Although simple to understand, implement and prove correct, the bubblesort algorithm is very inefficient: the number of comparisons between elements during its execution is, on average, proportional to N2, where N is the number of elements in the sequence. You have been asked to do a ""reverse engineering"" of the bubblesort, ie, given the length of the sequence, the number of shifts required to sort and the number of exchanges that occurred at every turn, your program must find a possible sequence, when sorted, produces exactly the same number of exchanges in shifts.";The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two integers N and M respectively indicate that the number of elements (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) in the sequence that is being ordered, and the number of turns (0 ≤ M ≤ 100,000) needed to sort the sequence using bubblesort. The second line of a test case contains M integers Xi, indicating the number of exchanges in each round i (1 ≤ Xi ≤ N - 1, for 1 ≤ i ≤ M). The end of input is indicated by N = M = 0.;"For each test case in the input your program must produce one line of output, containing a permutation of the numbers {1, 2, ..., N}, which when sorted using bubblesort produces the same number of exchanges in the same number of turns specified at the input.

If there is more than one solution satisfying this constraint, print, among them, the one where the second element is the largest possible.

1389;Traveling Shoemaker Problem;Graph;9;"Once upon a time there was a very peaceful country named Nlogonia. Back then, Poly the Shoemaker could come to the country and travel freely from city to city doing his job without any harassment. This task was very easy, as every city in Nlogonia had a direct road to every other city in the country. He could then easily travel the whole country visiting each city exactly once and fixing everybody's shoes.

                But not anymore. The times have changed and war has come to Nlogonia. The age when people could travel freely is over.

                Confederations identified by colors were formed among the cities all over the country, and now each city belongs to at least one and at most two confederations. When trying to enter a city, you must give to the border officer a ticket from one of the confederations this city belongs to. When leaving the city, you receive a ticket from the other confederation the city belongs to (i.e. different from the one you gave when entering) or from the same confederation if the city only belongs to one.

                As Poly the Shoemaker is a long time friend of Nlogonia, he is allowed to choose a ticket and a city he wants to enter as the first city in the country, but after that he must obey the confederations rules. He wants to do the same routine he did before, visiting each city exactly once in Nlogonia, but now it's not easy for him to do this, even though he can choose where to start his journey.

                For example, suppose there are four cities, labeled from 0 to 3. City 0 belongs to confederations red and green; city 1 belongs only to red; city 2 belongs to green and yellow; and city 3 belongs to blue and red. If Poly the Shoemaker chooses to start at city 0, he can enter it carrying either the red or the green ticket and leave receiving the other. Should he choose the red ticket, he will leave with a green ticket, and then there is only city 2 he can travel to. When leaving city 2 he receives the yellow ticket and now can't go anywhere else. If he had chosen the green ticket as the first he would receive the red one when leaving, and then he could travel to cities 1 or 3. If he chooses city 3, when leaving he will receive the blue ticket and again can't go anywhere else. If he chooses city 1, he receives the red ticket again when leaving (city 1 belongs only to the red confederation) and can only travel to city 3 and will never get to city 2. Thus, it is not possible to visit each city exactly once starting at city 0. It is possible, however, starting at city 2 with the yellow ticket, leaving the city with the green ticket, then visiting city 0, leaving with red ticket, then visiting city 1, leaving with red ticket again and, at last, visiting city 3.

In a number written in base B, the rightmost digit has its value multiplied by 1, the second rightmost digit has its value multiplied by B, the third rightmost digit has its value multiplied by B2, and so on.

                Some equations are true or false depending on the base they are considered in. The equation 2 + 2 = 4, for instance, is true for any B ≥ 5 - it does not hold in base 4, for instance, since there is no digit '4' in base 4. On the other hand, an equation like 2 + 2 = 5 is never true.

1391;Almost Shortest Path;Graph;5;"Finding the shortest path that goes from a starting point to a destination point given a set of points and route lengths connecting them is an already well known problem, and it’s even part of our daily lives, as shortest path programs are widely available nowadays.

                Most people usually like very much these applications as they make their lives easier. Well, maybe not that much easier.

                Now that almost everyone can have access to GPS navigation devices able to calculate shortest paths, most routes that form the shortest path are getting slower because of heavy traffic. As most people try to follow the same path, it’s not worth it anymore to follow these directions.

                With this in his mind, your boss asks you to develop a new application that only he will have access to, thus saving him time whenever he has a meeting or any urgent event. He asks you that the program must answer not the shortest path, but the almost shortest path. He defines the almost shortest path as the shortest path that goes from a starting point to a destination point such that no route between two consecutive points belongs to any shortest path from the starting point to the destination.

                For example, suppose the figure below represents the map given, with circles representing location points, and lines representing direct, one-way routes with lengths indicated. The starting point is marked as S and the destination point is marked as D. The bold lines belong to a shortest path (in this case there are two shortest paths, each with total length 4). Thus, the almost shortest path would be the one indicated by dashed lines (total length 5), as no route between two consecutive points belongs to any shortest path. Notice that there could exist more than one possible answer, for instance if the route with length 3 had length 1. There could exist no possible answer as well.

1392;Electric Bill;Mathematics;5;"It’s year 2100. Electricity has become very expensive. Recently, your electricity company raised the power rates once more. The table below shows the new rates (consumption is always a positive integer):

                

                This means that, when calculating the amount to pay, the ﬁrst 100 CWh have a price of 2 Americus each; the next 9900 CWh (between 101 and 10000) have a price of 3 Americus each and so on.

                For instance, if you consume 10123 CWh you will have to pay 2×100+3×9900+5×123 = 30515 Americus.

                The evil mathematicians from the company have found a way to gain even more money. Instead of telling you how much energy you have consumed and how much you have to pay, they will show you two numbers related to yourself and to a random neighbor:

                A: the total amount to pay if your consumptions were billed together; and
                    B: the absolute value of the diﬀerence between the amounts of your bills.

                If you can’t ﬁgure out how much you have to pay, you must pay another 100 Americus for such a “service”. You are very economical, and therefore you are sure you cannot possibly consume more than any of your neighbors. So, being smart, you know you can compute how much you have to pay. For example, suppose the company informed you the following two numbers: A = 1100 and B = 300. Then you and your neighbor’s consumptions had to be 150 CWh and 250 CWh respectively. The total consumption is 400 CWh and then A is 2×100+3×300 = 1100. You have to pay 2×100+3×50 = 350 Americus, while your neighbor must pay 2×100+3×150 = 650 Americus, so B is |350 − 650| = 300.

                ​

                Mary loves mathematics. When going to school, she steps on the tiles of that path following these rules:

                
                    She always starts from the tile with the smiling face (as nothing matches starting anything with a smile!). This tile is always present at the beginning of the path. The other tiles are numbered consecutively, in ascending order, starting from 1, as shown in the figure.
                    She is not allowed to go back, that is, she must not step on a tile which bears a lower number than the tile she is on (when decided to go to school, there she goes!).
                    She always steps from a tile to a neighboring one (no jumps in order to keep out of harm's way!).

1395;Numbers and Operations;Paradigms;9;"We want to solve the classical problem of obtaining a given target number starting from a set of initial numbers according to the following rules:

                
                    All numbers involved in the problem are positive integers, and so must be any intermediate result obtained for any operation. Thus, operations that lead to non integer or non positive numbers are strictly forbidden (we shall not consider truncation or rounding results, nor anything else like that).
                    We can do any of the four elemental arithmetical operations: addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division.
                    Each number may be used once at most: when we take two numbers and operate them, these numbers may not be used again in further operations (but the result of this operation may, and same considerations apply to this new number).
                    There is no obligation to make use of all of the initial numbers.
                

                We shall make the following assumptions on the input data:

                
                    For any target number T, it will always hold that: 0 < T < 2000.

                    We shall not consider trivial problem cases, i.e. cases in which the target number is already contained in the initial ones.
                

                In order to make unique the solution provided by the program, we shall also make the following assumptions on the solution that we will consider as correct: The program should provide the solution that reaches the target in the minimum number of operations. If there is more than one solution with the minimum number of operations, we will decide which one to take according to the characteristics of the first operation in which they differ. The next rules will apply.

                
                    For two operations that are actually the same one, it will be preferred the one whose left-side operand is greater than, or equal to, the right-side operand. For example, operation ""10 x 5 = 50"" will take priority over ""5 x 10 = 50"".
                    For operations involving two different operators, it will be preferred the one whose operator has the highest precedence, defined as follows: Addition (highest) Multiplication Subtraction Division (lowest)

1404;MegaCheckers;Ad-Hoc;7;"MegaCheckers is a board game for two players, very similar to the known Checkers game. The board is rectangular, with N lines and M columns of small squares arranged in a grid N x M. The small squares are alternately colored with a bright color and a dark color, on the usual standard of a checker’s board. The squares of dark colors are denominated “houses” (notice that, for visualization reasons, the diagrams below show houses as white squares).

                At the beginning of the match, each player has a certain number of pieces, positioned on the nearest houses from the board edge that the player chose (the players choose opposite edges). During the match, the pieces can only occupy the houses on the board.

                One of the movements of the game is “capture” an opponent piece, jumping over it, diagonally, to the adjacent house through the piece, house that should be empty. The opponent piece is so removed from the board. The three involved houses on the capture (your piece’s initial house, the house that contains the opponent’s piece and the empty house, where your piece will be after the move) should be diagonally aligned and must be diagonally adjacent, as shown in the diagram below.

                

                In MegaCheckers a piece can capture opponent’s pieces jumping diagonally forward or backward (notice that, on the existents variations of the Checkers game, a piece can only capture opponent’s pieces jumping forward). You may also make a multiple capture, with one piece only, then jumping to empty houses over opponent’s pieces. In a multiple capture, your piece may change direction, jumping first in one direction and then in another. You can capture just one piece in each jump, but can capture several pieces with sequentially jumps. You can’t jump over a piece of yours, and can’t jump the same opponent’s piece more than once.

                It’s given the board dimensions and a description of the current match state. It is your turn to play and you must determine the maximum number of opponent’s pieces that can be captured in a capture movement.";"The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two integers N and M, indicating, respectively, the number of lines and the number of columns of the board (3 ≤ N ≤ 20, 3 ≤ M ≤ 20 and N x M ≤ 200). The square at the bottom left corner of the board is a house. The second line contains a description of the match state. Each description consists of [(N x M)/2] integers, separated by a space, corresponding to the boards houses, that are numbered from 1 to [(N x M)/2], from the left to the right, from the nearest edge from the player to the nearest edge from the opponent. On the state match description, ‘0’ represents an empty house, ‘1’ represents a house with one of your pieces, and ‘2’ represents a house with an opponent’s piece. There are, at most, [(N x M)/4] pieces of each player on the board. The input final is indicated by N = M = 0.

1405;The Halting Problem;Data Structures and Libraries;10;"The halting problem is a classic Computer Science decision problem which consists basically in determining whether a given program will always stop (ie, terminate its execution) for a given arbitrary input or will run forever. Alan Turing proved in 1936 that it is impossible to solve the halting problem generalizing for any pair program-input. In this problem, however, given the description of a simple language, a program written in this language and an entry to this program, you must determine if the given program stops with the given input, and if so, what is the output produced.

                This language only works with integer numbers from 0 to 999 (inclusive). Thus, the successor of 999 is 0, and the predecessor of 0 is 999. Furthermore, it has ten variables (R0 to R9), where R0 is always assigned the value of program call (ie, the input parameter) and R9 is always assigned the output value (the return). At the beginning of the program, is assigned the value 0 to all variables, except for R0 that receives the input parameter.

                The basics operations are: attribution (MOV), sum (ADD), subtraction (SUB), multiplication (MUL), integer division (DIV) and rest of integer division (MOD). All these operation have a syntax COMMAND OPERATOR1,OPERATOR2 (without spaces between the comma and the operators), where COMMAND is one of these operations, OPERATOR1 is one of the ten variables (R0 to R9) and OPERATOR2 could be one of the ten variables or an integer value (between 0 and 999). All operations change the value of OPERATOR1, thus MOV R4,100 is equivalent to assigned 100 to R4, as MUL R3,R8 is equivalent to multiply R3 by R8 and assigned the result to R3. The operation DIV, as well as MOD, returns 0 (zero) if OPERATOR2 is 0 or if the equivalent variable has the value 0. Thus, DIV R4,0 is equivalent as MOV R4,0. For integer division, we understand the integer part of quotient of the division (no fractional part). For example, the integer division of 7 by 2 is 3 (the rest being 1).

                There are six decision flow commands: IFEQ (if equal), IFNEQ (if different), IFG (if greater), IFL (if less), IFGE (if greater or equal) e IFLE (if less or equal). The syntax for all them is COMMAND OPERATOR1,OPERATOR2 (without spaces between the comma and the operators), where OPERATOR1 and OPERATOR2 could be variables (R0 to R9) or integer values (between 0 to 999). Thus, the command IFEQ R4,123 is the equivalent to test is R4 is equal 123. If the tested condition is true, the program continues to run the next line of the decision command normally. If the condition is false, the program turns to run the next line of the nearest ENDIF. All of the decision commands must have an ENDIF command correspondent.

                Finally, there are the commands CALL and RET, both with the syntax COMMAND OPERATOR, where OPERATOR is a variable (R0…R9) or direct value (between 0 and 999). The command CALL calls the program again, given the OPERATOR as an input parameter, assigning the value of the OPERATOR to the variable R0. The command RET finishes the program execution returning the value of the OPERATOR as an output result. The last line of the program will always be a command RET. Note that if the program calls itself by the command CALL, when the program execution returns the value of R9 will be changed with the output value returned by the program. Note also that all of the variables (R0…R9) are locals, it means that, when the program calls itself, it cannot change the values stored in the variables of the previous instance, in exception of the value of R9 that receives the return of the called instance.

                The following example illustrates a program that calculates the factorial of a number.

                

                1st line: Check if the value of R0 is equal 0, if so runs the next line else jump to the 4th line (nearest ENDIF).

                2nd line: Return 1 as output of the program.

                3rd line: Mark the end of the decision block initiated at the first line.

                4th line: Assign the value from R0 to R1 (R1 ← R0).

                5th line: Decrement 1 from R1 (R1 ← R1 – 1).

                6th line: Call the program passing R1 as input parameter.

                7th line: Save the value of R9 (returned by the previous call) in R2 (R2 ← R9).

                8th line: Multiply the value of R2 by R0 (R2 ← R2 * R0).

                9th line: Return the value of R2 as output of the program.

                The following table brings the summary of the commands for reference:";The input contains several test cases. Each test case initiates with two integers, L and N, representing respectively the numbers of lines of the program (1 ≤ L ≤ 100) and the value of the input parameter of the program (0 ≤ N ≤ 100). The following L lines contain the program. You can assume that it is always syntactically correct according to the rules defined above.

1406;Jukebox;Strings;10;"The ICPC judges are preparing a party for the opening ceremony. For the party, they intend to add a playlist with some songs to the jukebox software (a simple MP3 player). However, there are so many songs in the computer that it is difficult to find the ones they want to add. As a consequence, they need to use the search feature many times.

                In this jukebox, when you search for a string s, the software returns every music whose title or artist name contains s as a substring. String s is a substring of string t if t contains all characters of s as a contiguous sequence (for example, ‘bc’ is a substring of ‘abcd’, but ‘ac’ is not). To save their precious time, while looking for a song, they always use one of the song’s golden string, i.e. one of the shortest strings for which the search returns as a result only the song they want.

                

                In the example above, a possible golden string for the song ‘johnnatan’ is ‘ta’. Note that ‘ta’ is not a substring of the name of another song nor a substring of the artist of another song. Note also that there is no string of size equal to 1 that could identify uniquely the song ‘johnnatan’.

                ​

                They discovered that if they remove the artist fields from some of the songs they can get even smaller golden strings. For the song ‘john’, there is no golden string. However, if one removes the artist field from all other songs, the string ‘c’ becomes the golden string for the song ‘john’.

                Given the song list (each song with name and artist), your job is to determine the minimum sum of the golden string sizes for all songs that can be obtained if one is allowed to remove some of the artist fields. In the figure above you can see a possible best result with the golden strings in bold. The minimum sum of the golden string sizes in this case is 10.";"The input contains several test cases.

                To rent lockers to a new client, Mario likes to use adjacent lockers, after all, at the beginning of the rental a new client normally makes a lot of requisitions to access the content stored, and the fact that the lockers are adjacent helps when accessing it, both to Mario and to the client.

For example, if the requisition of a new client needs 4 lockers but only the lockers of numbers 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 are available, Mario can switch the positions of the lockers 5 and 2 and of the lockers 6 and 4, so that he can rent the interval of lockers from 1 to 4.

                However, to minimize the service time, Mario wants to do the smallest number of switches as possible to store each volume. On the example above, he could simply switch the lockers 1 and 4, and rent the interval from 3 to 6.

1409;Zak Galou;Graph;9;"Zak Galou is a famous wizard that kills monsters. The legend says that there is a hidden cave on the jungle confines that contains a millennial treasure. Until today, no adventurer managed to recover the treasure, because it is well guarded by terrible monsters. But Zak Galou is not an ordinary adventurer, and decided to prepare himself to recover the dreamed treasure.

                Zak Galou features a certain amount of mana (a sort of magical energy) and a list of M spells. Each monster has a determined number of life points. Each time that Zak Galou casts a spell against a monster, Zak spends a certain amount of mana (the spell’s cost) and inflicts a certain amount of damage to the monster. The inflicted damage leads to a loss of life points from the monster (the number of life points loss depends on the spell). A monster is dead if he has zero or less life points. Zak always fights against one monster at a time. As a powerful wizard, he can cast the same spell several times, since he has enough amount of mana.

                In his researches, Zak Galou found the treasure map. The cave is represented as a set of halls connected by galleries. The halls are identified sequentially from 1 to N. Zak always starts on the hall 1, and the treasure is always on the hall N. There are K monsters identified sequentially from 1 to K. Each monster lives inside a hall, from which he doesn’t leave (notice that is possible that more than one monster live on the same hall). During the search for the treasure, Zak Galou can only come out or recover a treasure from a hall if the hall is empty (with no monster). In other words, Zak must always, before leaves or recover the treasure from a hall, kill the monster(s) that lives in there.

1415;Galou is Back!;Graph;8;"The famous witch is back. After killing an incredible amount of monsters in order to find a hidden treasure, Zak Galou decided to buy vineyards in Burgundy and retired. Everything was calm in his new life, until the day that his farm tractor stopped working.

                His tractor’s engine works based on a mechanism of gears. The engine can be represented by a bidimensional grid. At most one gear can be attached to each position of the grid. All the gears are identical and can mesh with adjacent gears. In this grid, a gear can have up to six other adjacent gears, see figure below:

                

                Under normal utilization, when the tractor is started, some of the gears are initially activated and try to turn clockwise. When a gear tries to turn in one direction, all the adjacent gears try to turn in the opposite direction.

                When Zak Galou opened his engine he noticed that it had been sabotaged (probably by a jealous treasure hunter who was not able to find the treasure). Some of the gears were removed from the engine and others have been added to it. As a consequence, some of the gears were immobile. A gear can be immobile either if it is free or if it is blocked. A gear is free when it is not an initially activated gear and no adjacent gear is trying to turn. A gear is blocked when it is trying to turn in both directions at the same time. For example, consider that there are three gears in the engine as shown in the figure below. If any of the gears is initially activated when the tractor is started, all of them will be blocked. If none of the gears are initially activated, all of them will be free.

Employees that are not bosses of any other employee are called workers. The rest of the employees and the owner are called bosses.

                To ask for a salary increase, a worker should file a petition to his direct boss.

1420;Counting Seconds;Ad-Hoc;8;Through research and the spectacular development of revolutionary techniques of computing, statistics and intuition, a group of women at the University of Torrinha developed a software able to predict the future. In fact, the program cannot describe exactly what will happen, but by analyzing the responses to a series of questions about the person, it can identify when the next five most important events in her life will happen. The program has two small problems. The first is that the person upon whom one wants to predict the future need to spend hundreds of hours straight in front of the computer, answering questions asked by the software, so it can make the prediction. The second is that the predictions are made in number of seconds from the end of the processing. The girls of Torrinha are engaged in solving the first problem, and they asked to the Programming Marathon competitors a help to solve the second.;"The input consists of several predictions related to different people. The first line of each prediction contains the exact moment that the 5 numbers (corresponding to the 5 key moments) were printed by the program. This moment follows the format:

                where the <day of week> is the abbreviation of the weekday corresponding sequence composed of three uppercase characters corresponding to the days of the week from Sunday to Saturday respectively, such as: DOM, SEG, TER, QUA, QUI, SEX or SAB. <day> is the day of month, written with two digits, leading zero if necessary. <month> is the abbreviation of the corresponding month, comprising the sequence of 3 uppercase characters corresponding to the months from January to December, respectively, such as: JAN, FEV, MAR, ABR, MAI, JUN, JUL, AGO, SET, OUT, NOV or DEZ. <year> is the year, written with four digits. <hour>, <minute> and <second> written with two digits, leading zero if necessary.

                The following lines contain 5 moments, one per line, 5 lines per prediction. Each moment d is the number of seconds (0 < d < 2.000.000.000) from the time of processing. After the last test case, a line beginning with 'FIM' indicates the end of the input file.

                You can assume that the program developed on 01 March 2002 so that no prediction time is earlier than this. Another important fact is that the girls of Torrinha will only use the program until 23:59:59 of 31/12/2099 when one of them thinks she will die, because it was predicted by another program prepared by the department of women's intuition at Unitor (University of Torrinha).";Your program should identify each prediction in the output by a serial number in the first line, and the following five lines you must write five full moments relating to the prediction made ​​in the same format used on the input to process th prediction.

This error makes the bacteria die after living for 4 days. Since the first colony was created 3 days before, he quickly modified the genetic code (through radiation), in such a way that his bacteria reproduce every day. This is an asexual reproduction, and is done by bi-partitioning (i.e., one bacterium generates exactly one other bacterium in a day).

1431;Klingon Levels;Ad-Hoc;8;"In a Latin American high school, the klingon language has become so popular that many of the students have begun learning this artificial language on their own. After becoming aware of the situation, the directors have decided to implement formal klingon courses. The problem is that kids have different starting levels of knowledge of the language. Therefore, the directors decided to offer two course levels: basic and advanced.

                The school has several divisions, with each student belonging to exactly one division. Because of bureaucracy and schedule conflicts, students of different divisions cannot be in the same klingon course. Also, to be fair, the basic and advanced klingon levels should be offered to all divisions, and have the same level of difficulty among the divisions.

                Therefore, each division will be partitioned into two groups: one group will be assigned a basic level course, and the other group an advanced level course. It is possible, also, that a division does not contain any students in one of the levels.

                To assign the levels, a klingon test has been previously taken by all students of the school, each getting an integer grade between 0 and 1000, inclusive. To accomplish the aforementioned goals, the school directors have decided that all students with a score greater than or equal to some T will be assigned the advanced level, and all students with a score less than T will be assigned the basic level.

                However, they cannot decide on the best value of T. They would like a value that evenly splits all divisions. For this, they came up with a metric: They want the value of T that minimizes the accumulated difference, that is, the sum of the difference between the number of students in the two groups (basic and advanced) within each division.

                For example, if the school has two divisions, where one division has 10 students in the basic level and 20 in the advanced level, while the other one has 17 and 15, respectively, the accumulated difference would be |10 − 20| + |17 − 15| = 12.";"There are several test cases.

                The last condition makes sure that there is no relatively small-age group which might feel uncomfortable in the section. For instance, let denote by [N, M] a group with N members who are M-years old. Then in section {[10, 50], [6, 45], [70, 12], [43, 23]} the maximum number of people with the same age is 70, the minimum number of people with the same age is 6. If R = 2.0, then we say this section does not satisfy the requirement (C) since 70/6 > 2.0. However, we can split this section into two smaller sections, namely {[10, 50],[6, 45]} and {[70, 12], [43, 23]}, which satisfy all the requirements.

                Given the splitting factor R and a list of the members of the club, you must write a program to ﬁnd the minimum number of sections satisfying the three requirements above.";"Your program should process several test cases.

1434;Roman Patrollers;Mathematics;6;"In ancient times, patrollers were used to ensure that all the cities of the Roman Empire were under control. A patroller’s job consisted in continuously visiting the cities of the empire, trying to minimise the interval between two visits to each city. The Military Society (MS) wants to simulate the behavior of one such patroller to see how eﬀective they were. 

                Each cycle of the simulation corresponds to one time unit. The Instantaneous City Idleness (ICI) for a city X after T cycles of the simulation is the number of cycles elapsed since the last visit of the patroller to the city X (i.e. the number of time units the city X remained unvisited). All of the cities have initial Instantaneous City Idleness equal to zero at the start of the simulation. The Instantaneous Empire Idleness (IEI) after each given cycle is the sum of the Instantaneous City Idleness of all cities after that given cycle. Finally, the Empire Idleness (EI) for an N-cycle simulation is the sum of the Instantaneous Empire Idleness after each of the N cycles of simulation.

                After visiting a city X, the patroller always chooses to visit the neighbour city Y with the highest Instantaneous City Idleness (if more than one city has the highest idleness, the one with the lowest identiﬁer is chosen). Cities X and Y are neighbour if there is a road linking the two cities directly, without going through any intermediate city. In the beginning of the simulation, the patroller is located in one of the cities, and is given a map of the Roman Empire containing a description of all the roads in the empire, indicating the length (in kilometers) and which two cities each road connects. A road between cities X and Y can be used both to go from X to Y and from Y to X.

                Assuming that a patroller travels one kilometer in one time unit (one simulation cycle) and that the time to visit a city is negligible (equal to zero), MS asks you to determine the Empire Idleness after an N-cycle simulation.

                For clarity, consider the example of an empire which contains 3 cities (1, 2 and 3) and two roads of length 1 km. The first road connects cities 1 and 2, while the second road connects cities 2 and 3. Below you ﬁnd a trace of a 3-cycle simulation for such a scenario, considering that the patroller starts at city 1.

Joãozinho is a very systematic boy, so before opening any box, he wants to recover his inventory. Joãozinho is also a very awkward kid. To take a box from a stack, it needs to be at the top of the stack and at least one of its sides, no matter which, has to be free (ie, have no adjacent box).

1439;Bora Bora;Data Structures and Libraries;8;"Bora Bora is a simple card game for children, invented in the South Pacific Island of the same name. Two or more players can play, using a deck of standard cards. Cards have the usual ranks: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and King. Each card has also one of four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades.

                Players sit on a circle around the table and play by turns. The next player to play may be the one to the left (clockwise direction) or to the right (counter-clockwise direction) of the current player, depending on the cards played, as we will see. At the start, the direction of play is clockwise.

                The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of cards. The remaining of the deck is placed, face down, on the table; this is called the stock pile. Then the first (topmost) card is removed from the stock and placed on the table, face up, starting another pile, called the discard pile.

                The objective of the game is for a player to discard all his cards. At each turn, a player discards at most one card. A card can be discarded only if it has the same rank or the same suit as the topmost card on the discard pile. A player discards a card by placing it, face up, in the discard pile (this card becomes the topmost). If a player does not have a suitable card to discard on his turn, he must draw one card from the stock and add it to his hand; if he can discard that card, he does so, otherwise he does nothing else and his turn ends. A player always discards the highest valued card he possibly can. The value of a card is determined first by the card rank and then by the card suit. The rank order is the rank itself (Ace is the lowest, King is the highest), and the suit order is, from lowest to highest, Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts and Spades. Therefore, the highest valued card is the King of Spades and the lowest valued card is the Ace of Clubs. As an example, a Queen of Diamonds has a higher value than a Jack (any suit) but has a lower value than a Queen of Hearts.

                Some of the discarded cards affect the play, as follows:

                
                    When a Queen is discarded, the direction of play is reversed: if the direction is clockwise, it changes to counter-clockwise, and vice-versa;
                    When a Seven is discarded, the next player to play must draw two cards from the stock (the number of cards in his hand increases by two), and misses his turn (does not discard any card);
                    When an Ace is discarded, the next player to play must draw one card from the stock (the number of cards in his hand increases by one), and misses his turn (does not discard any card);
                    When a Jack is discarded, the next player to play misses his turn (does not discard any card).
                

                Notice that the penalty for the first card in the discard pile (the card draw from the stock at the beginning) is applied to the first player to play. For example, if the first player to play is p and the first card on the discard pile is an Ace, player p draws a card from the stock and does not discard any card on his first turn. Also notice that if the first card is a Queen, the direction of play is reversed to counter-clockwise, but the first player to play remains the same.

                The winner is the player who first discards all his cards (the game ends after the winner discards his last card).

Each of the next N lines contains the description of one card. A card is described by one integer X and one character S, separated by one space, representing respectively the card rank and the card suite. Card ranks are mapped to integers from 1 to 13 (Ace is 1, Jack is 11, Queen is 12 and King is 13). Card suits are designated by the suit’s first letter: ‘C’ (Clubs), ‘D’ (Diamonds), ‘H’ (Hearts) or ‘S’ (Spades).

                Players are identified by numbers from 1 to P , and sit on a circle, in clockwise direction, 1, 2 ... P, 1. The first P x M cards of the deck are dealt to the players: the first M cards to the first player (player 1), the next M to the second player (player 2), and so on. After dealing the cards to the players, the next card on the deck — the (P x M + 1)-th card — is used to start the discard pile, and the remaining cards form the stock. The (P x M + 2)-th card to appear on the input is the topmost card on the stock, and the last card to appear on the input (the N-th card) is the bottommost card of the stock (the last card that can be drawn).

1440;Dinner Hall;Ad-Hoc;7;"The University administration plans to build a new dinner hall, to replace the several small (and rather inadequate) dinner halls spread over the campus. To estimate the number of places needed in the new dinner hall, they performed an experiment to measure the maximum total number of clients inside the existing dinner halls at any time. They hired several students as pollers, and positioned one poller at each entrance and each exit of the existing dinner halls. The pollers' task was to note in small cards the time each client entered or exited the hall (one card for each event). In each card they wrote the time, in the format HH:MM:SS, and the associated event (letter 'E' for an entry, letter 'X' for and exit).

                The experiment started in the morning, before breakfast, and ended in the evening, after dinner. The pollers had their watches synchronized, and the halls were empty both before and after the experiment (that is, no client was inside a hall before the experiment began, and no client remained in a hall after the experiment ended). The pollers wrote exactly one card for every client who entered a hall and for every client who exited a hall.

                After the experiment, the cards were collected and sent to the administration for processing. The task, however, was not as easy as planned, because two problems were detected. Firstly, the cards were bunched together in no particular order and therefore needed sorting; that is fairly easy, but time-consuming to do by hand. But what is worse is that, although all cards had a valid time, some pollers forgot to write the letter specifying the event. The University administration decided they needed help from an expert!

Each of the next N lines contains the information written in a card, consisting of a time specification, followed by a single space, followed by an event specification. A time specification has the format HH : MM : SS, where HH represents hours (06 ≤ HH ≤ 23), MM represents minutes (00 ≤ MM ≤ 59) and SS represents seconds (00 ≤ SS ≤ 59). Within a test case, no two cards have the same time. An event specification is a single character: uppercase 'E' for entry, uppercase 'X' for exit and '?' for unknown. Information may be missing, but the information given is always correct. That is, the times noted in all cards are valid. Also, if a card describes an entry, then a client did enter a hall at the informed time; if a card describes an exit, then a client did leave a hall at the informed time; and if a card describes an unknown event, then a client did enter or leave a hall at the informed time.

1444;Drakes' Racing;Mathematics;3;"Pirabeiraba is a district of Joinville, where german settlers installed themselves at the start of the 20th century. Annually there is the cassava party, a tuber that is also known as macaxeira in the brazilian northeast region. To accompany the cassava, there's nothing like a traditional germanic dish: the stuffed drake! For the culinary experts, there is a magic in this combination: drake with cassava. However, to kill the drake, you must capture him while his blood is very warm. For that, the drake must be tired. People say that his warm blood is synonymous with fertility, in other words: an aphrodisiac! But that's for another story.

In this game of chasing the drake, an idea came of tiring them with a race between themselves. The physical space of the Society Rio da Prata is limited, because of that they built only three lanes to do these races. The races are made with groups of two and three drakes. The drakes who gets the first places on the races are then arranged again in groups of 2 or 3 for another round. This goes on until there's only one drake left, the champion, which escapes from the saucepan (for now) as a prize. All the surviving drakes must race in the round, that is, if it's not possible to split all the drakes in groups of three, some groups of two must be formed in order to minimize the number of races. Examples are seen in the Figure 1.

1457;Oracle of Alexandria;Mathematics;3;"Every Computer Scientist worth his salt knows the book ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" and knows the answer to the fundamental question about life, the universe and everything. But what few know is that the story of Douglas Adams is based on an Egyptian legend, of an oracle located in Eskendereyya (Alexandria). Alexandria today is the largest city of Egypt, with more than 4 million inhabitants. It is in the Nile Delta, and stretches for 32km along the Mediterranean coast. In the past, the city founded in 331 BC by Alexander the Great, was one of the main cities in the world and there was the Lighthouse of Alexandria (one of the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World), the Library of Alexandria (the largest in the ancient world) and other fantastic works. The legend also says that there was the great oracle of Alexandria. The townspeople delivered the oracle small tickets with numbers noted, and received back a number, that would be the answer to a fundamental question of the universe related to the two given numbers.

                In his treatise of 227 AD Cleomenes of Naucratis (who became administrator of Alexandria when Alexander departed for his conquests) reports some results of the oracle:

                
                    Given 8 and 1 the oracle returned 40320;
                    Given 10 and 3, returned 280;
                    Given 4 and 2, returned 8;
                    Given 21 and 19, returned 42.
                

                Modern studies realized that what the oracle returned was nothing more than a generalization of the factorial of an integer. As we know,

                N! = N x (N-1) x ... x 1.

                What the oracle returned for the data N and K, was the K-factor of N, in other words,

                N x (N-K) x (N-2K) x (N-3K) x ...,

                in which the product was made while the difference is greater than or equal to 1. We can represent the K-factor of a number for him followed by K exclamations:

                
                    8! = 40320;
                    10!!! = 280;
                    4!! = 8;
                    21!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! = 42

The keyboard has the following layout:

                As it is only allowed to use the thumb to press the keys, all of them were made in a square format with a side of 1 centimeter, without spaces between two adjacent keys. The keys 2 to 9 are used to type the letters 'a' to 'z', and they work like any other cellphone: if we want one of the associated letters of that key, we must press that key the same number of the position of the letter. For example, pressing the key 3 once, we get 'd'. If we press it again, we get 'e' and again we get 'f'. If we continuing pressing this same key, we have the number '3' and then restart in 'd'. The key 0 is used to insert spaces in the message; the keys 1 and * are not used in this competition.

                In the case of two consecutive letters that are formed by the same key, it will be necessary to use the key #. The function of this key is separate the pressing sequences of two letters of same key. For example, to write the word ""cake"", the sequence of tightening keys should be: 2, 2, 2, #, 2, 5, 5, 3, 3.

                To make things more interesting, the organization had decided that in this year the message must be written in free fall: the competitors jump from a plane with the cellphone in your hands and then types the message; a sofisticated computer system will open the parachute automatically when the message is totaly typed without mistakes. However, this modification in the rules has introduced a new difficulty: to avoid the loss of the cellphone during the fall, it is necessary use one thumb to hold the equipement while the other thumb presses a key or it's moved, which implies that one of the thumbs will be kept fixed.

In a certain mountain, an interesting situation occurs in a rectangular area of N x M properties. Starting from anywhere within the region, traversing it in the West to East direction, the properties have non-descending heights. Similarly, traversing that region in the North to South direction, starting from anywhere, the properties have also non-descending heights.

The company is interested in some special varieties of wine grapes, which are productive only if grown in properties whose heights are within a certain interval. That is, the company is interested in renting properties whose heights are equal to or higher than a given altitude L, and equal to or lower than a given altitude U. To make it easier for harvesting, the rented properties must form a contiguous area. And since everyone in Quadradonia likes squares, the area to be rented must have the shape of a square.

1464;Onion Layers;Computational Geometry;8;"Dr. Kabal, a well recognized biologist, has recently discovered a liquid that is capable of curing the most advanced diseases. The liquid is extracted from a very rare onion that can be found in a country called Onionland. But not all onions of Onionland are worth to take to the lab for processing. Only those onions with an odd number of layers contain the miraculous liquid. Quite an odd discovery!

                

                Figure 1: Onion from Onionland

                Dr. Kabal has hired a lot of research assistants to collect and analyse onions for him. Since he does not want to share his discovery with the world yet, he didn’t tell the assistants to look for onions with an odd number of layers. Instead, each assistant was given the task of collecting onions, and selecting points from each of the layer’s outer borders, so that an approximation of the layer structure of the onion can be reconstructed later. Dr. Kabal told the assistants that the next step will be a “complicated analysis” of these points. In fact, all he will do is simply to use the points to count the number of layers in each of the onions, and select the ones with an odd number of layers.

                

                Figure 2: Points collected by an assistant

                It is clear that the approximation obtained by Dr. Kabal, from the points collected, might have a different shape than the original onion. For instance, only some of the points of the onion shown in Figure 1 would be extracted in the process, giving rise to a set of points as shown in Figure 2. With these points Dr. Kabal will try to approximate the original layers of the onion, obtaining something like what is shown in Figure 3. The approximation procedure followed by Dr. Kabal (whose result is shown in Figure 3) is simply to recursively find nested convex polygons such that at the end every point belongs to precisely one of the polygons. The assistants have been told to select points in such a way that the number of layers in the approximation, if done in this recursive manner, will be the same as in the original onion, so that is fine with Dr. Kabal. The assistants are also aware that they need at least three points to approximate a layer, even the innermost one.

This year the organization of our competition have been more prudent: it got the project design of the ceiling of the hall, and wants your help to determine what will happen to a loose balloon depending on the position on the ground where it is released (that is, whether it is blocked by the ceiling or escapes to the outside of the hall).

The ceiling of the hall consists of several plans that, viewed from the side, can be described by line segments, as shown in the figure below:



The balloon may be considered to be a point. When a balloon touches a line segment that is horizontal, it gets stuck. When a balloon touches a segment that is tilted, the balloon glides to the highest point of the segment and escapes. It may then escape from the hall or it may touch more segments. There are no points in common between the line segments that form the ceiling.

For example, if a balloon is released at the positions marked as a or b, it will be stuck in the position with coordinates (2, 5); if a balloon is released at the position marked c, it will be stuck in the position of coordinates (6, 5); and if the balloon is released at the position marked as d, it will not be blocked and will escape out of the hall in the position of coordinate x = 7.

Write a program that, given the description of the ceiling of the hall as line segments, answers a series of queries about the final positions of balloons released at the hall floor.";"The input contains several test cases and ends with EOF.

As several “.com” companies, Iks started in a small garage, but today employs hundr eds of thousands. Iks has also a non-standard management system. For example, there are no c ommittees or boards, which means less time spent on internal meetings. However, as usual i n other companies, there is a chain (or rather several chains) of command, as a person may manage other emp loyees, and may be managed by other employees. The figure below shows the chain of comman d for some employees, along with their ages.



A person P1 may manage another person P2 directly (when P1 is the immediate superior of P2 ) or indirectly (when P1 manages direclty a person P3 who manages P2 directly or indirectly). For example, in the figure above, Alice manages David directly and Claire in directly. A person does not manage himself/herself, either directly or indirectly. One folklore that developed in Wall Street is that Iks is so successf ull because in its chain of command a manager is always younger than the managed employee.

1470;Folding Machine;Ad-Hoc;4;"One of the main tools of a Turing machine, which allows its computing power to be bigger than other simpler models, is an infinite tape, divided in cells, where information is stored.

A Folding machine is a machine inspired by a Turing machine. In a Folding machine, the tape is finite, the data are integers and instead of having the functionality of the original Turing machine, this machine uses folding tape operations.

To perform a folding operation, the machine chooses a position between adjacent cells and folds the tape, adding the values of overlapping cells, as can seen in the figure below.



Notice that the machine can also fold the tape before the tape center, as shown in the next figure. The machine can also choose to fold at the tape start or at the tape end, actually inverting the tape.



Science of Bends Company is developing commercial versions of their Folding machine and its production have recently raised. The last lot produced, unfortunately, have some issues and some machines aren’t working properly. Some additional testing is therefore needed, to avoid selling defective machines, which would denigrate the company’s image.

To test these machines, a set of tests and tapes are given. For each tape, the machine returns some computation result. Therefore, the engineers responsible for testing take note of the results and can verify if they are correct. But these engineers forgot to take note of which computation was made in each test case. To avoid re-testing all machines again, the engineers agreed that any combination of foldings is sound and accepted if, from a given input, it generates the expected output.

1480;The Famous Mine Sweeper;Ad-Hoc;10;"Mine Sweeper is an old game, that became famous for being a native game on an operational system that nobody remembers the name. It is about a grid with N rows and M columns, containing several spread mines, and several tips indicating where they would be. Your task is to find all the mines, with never stepping at one.

                Each position of the grid may or may not contain a mine. In the case it does not contain a mine, such position will contain a value, known as tip, that will identify how many mines are there on the adjacent squares (on the 8 directions), that varies between 0 and 8 (see Figure 1).

                

                Rafael became very interested by the game proposal, and found it so easy that he decided to write by himself some game cases, where he defines where the mines are going to be and what are the initial tips. He noticed, however, that there are two situations that can occur during the match: in determined cases, it is possible to find out with certainty where the mine is, thanks to the given tips; however in other cases, it is not possible to find out with certainty where the mine is, and the player will have to rely only on his luck.

                Consider the match as follows: there is, initially, a determined number of uncovered squares (tips) and the rest of them covered. The player can perform two movements: reveal a covered square, either finding a mine (game over) or a tip; or signal a covered square as being a mine, in such a way to prevent himself of never revealing that square.

                In order to procedure during the match in a logic way (without relying on luck), take into account the following definitions, relative to a set of adjacent squares from some square being analysed:

                
                    When the number of covered squares (adjCov), added to the signaled squares (adjSig) is equal to the tip (adjCov + adjSig = tip), then all the covered squares contain mines.
                    When the number of signaled squares (adjSig) is equal to the tip (adjSig = tip), then all the covered squares do not contain mines.
                

                See as an example the Figure 2.

                

                At part a) of the figure, we have adjCov = 1, adjSig = 0 and tip = 1, then 1 + 0 = 1, and we can signal the covered squares to identify the mines.

                At part b) of the figure, we have adjSig = 1 and tip = 1, then 1 = 1, and we can reveal the adjacent squares yet covered.

                So that his game case could become interesting and challenger, Rafael decided that it should be possible to find all the mines based only at the given definition, but he does not know how to verity when this is possible, and that is why he asked your help.";"The input will contain several test cases.

1482;Long Night of Museums;Graph;9;"The city of Vienna is called the “City of Culture” because (among other things) there are more than 100 museums in the city. As a consequence, it is very difficult (and very expensive) to visit all of them no matter how long you stay in the city. Fortunately, there is a special night, called the “Long Night of Museums”, when you can visit many museums with just one ticket, from 6:00 pm to 1:00 am of the next day.

                Nevertheless, it is impossible to visit every museum of the city for two main reasons. First, some museums in Vienna don’t get involved into this event because they close at 5:00 pm. Second, there is not enough time in 7 hours to go to every museum, watch ALL their insides (otherwise, it would be a waste of time), and then go to the others.

                Given the number of museums participating in the Long Night of Museums, the time needed to watch the insides of each museum, and the time that it will take to get from each museum to the others, you have to find the best tour to visit as many museums as you can during the Long Night of Museums.";The input contains several test cases.

1483;Animal Game;Ad-Hoc;5;"In a not very distant country, people are addicted on a simple bet game. The game is based in numbers and is called ""Animal Game"". The game received this name because the numbers are divided in 25 groups, depending of the value of the two last digits (tens and units). Each group is associated with an animal in the following form: the first group (donkey) is formed by the numbers 01, 02, 03 and 04; the second group (eagle) is formed by the numbers 05, 06, 07 and 08; and so on until the last group, formed by the numbers 97, 98, 99 and 00. The rules of he game are simple. In the moment of the bet, the player decides the value of the bet V and a number N (0 ≤ N ≤ 1000000). All the days, in the main square of the city, a number M is drawn (0 ≤ M ≤ 1000000). The prize is calculated as follows:

                
                    If M and N have the same four last digits (thousands, hundreds, tens and units), the bettor receives V × 3000 (for example, N = 99301 and M = 19301)

                    If M and N have the same last three digits (hundreds, tens and units), the bettor receives V × 500 (for example, N = 38944 and M = 83944)

                    If M and N have the same last two digits (tens and units), the bettor receives 50 × V (for example, N = 111 and M = 552211)

                    If M and N have the last two digits in the same group, corresponding to the same animal, the bettor receives V × 16 (for example, N = 82197 and M = 337600)

                    If none of the above occurs, the bettor don't receive any money.

                    Obviously, the award given to the bettor is the maximum possible according to the rules above. However, it is not possible to accumulate awards, so that only one of the above criteria should be applied in calculating the award. If the number N or M has less than four digits, assume that the digit 0 must be added in front of the number to make it a number of length four, for example, 17 corresponds to 0017.

He had a great time playing with games on his cell phone, but now the battery is dead and since there is no electricity on the island, he stopped playing. Strike Boy then decided to invent a new hobby, using the keypad of his cell phone. In this new game, for two players, one chooses two integers S and D. The opposing player must then find a sequence of terms such that:

                
                    Each term of the sequence is a number with  D  decimal digits, except for the last term, which can have between 1 and D digits;

                    Each digit is used at most once in the sequence;
                    The first term of a sequence can begin with any digit, but the order of the digits of the sequence when read from left to right, is such that the next key always corresponds to a key that is immediately adjacent to the previously used key (vertically, horizontally or diagonally).
                

                For example, if  S  = 230 and  D  = 3, there are only two possible solutions obeying the rules of the game : [074, 156] and [085, 142, 3]. The sequence [230] is not a solution because the '3 'key is not a neighbor of the key '0 '.

1485;Turkish Roulette;Paradigms;7;"Turkish Roulette is a betting game that uses a roulette with S slots, each one numbered with an integer between -64 and 64. In each turn of the game players bet on B balls, each one also numbered from -64 to 64. For each of the B balls, exactly one player will bet on it.

                After spinning the roulette, the dealer throws in the B balls sequentially. When the roulette stops, each ball is lodged over two (adjacent) slots, as depicted in the figure below, which shows a roulette with thirty two slots and four balls. Notice that, as the figure illustrates, a ball occupies the space of two adjacent slots, and therefore there is room for at most floor(S/2) balls in the roulette.

               

                Balls end up lodged in the same relative positions that they were thrown in the roulette. That is, if balls a, b and c are thrown in that sequence, they end up lodged such that, in clockwise direction, a is followed by b which is followed by c which is followed by a.

                The value of a ball in a turn is calculated by multiplying the ball’s number by the sum of the numbers of the two adjacent slots over which the ball is lodged. If a ball’s value is positive, the player who bet on that ball receives that amount (the ball’s value) from the dealer; if a ball’s value is negative, the player who bet on that ball must pay that amount to the dealer. The profit of the dealer in a turn is the total amount received minus the total amount paid.

                For example, in the figure above, the dealer pays $5.00 for ball numbered −1, pays $7.00 for ball numbered −7, receives $24.00 for ball numbered 12 and does not pay nor receive anything for ball numbered 3. Therefore, in this turn the dealer makes a profit of $12.00 (24 − 5 − 7); note that the dealer’s profit in a turn may be negative (loss).

1486;Biochemical Digital Circuit;Ad-Hoc;5;"A biochemical digital circuit (BDC) is an artifact composed of a set of processing nodes. Each processing node is composed of a tiny receptacle for biochemical reagents, made of a biological substrate that acts as a digital electronic chip. Depending on the state of the reaction in the receptacle, the substrate generates two voltage levels. A reader coupled to the BDC is able to perform the reading of all the processing nodes of a BDC in a given instant, interpreting the two voltage levels as 0 or 1.

                An experiment with the BDC is performed as follows. The processing nodes are loaded with substances of interest and appropriate reagents and, at every fixed interval of time (typically a few milliseconds), the processing nodes are read. Thus, the experiment results in a sequence of sets (vectors) of bits, each vector representing a measurement of the BDC.

                An uninterrupted sequence of bits 1 of a same processing node along the time is called a toothpick. The length of a toothpick is the number of bits 1 that composes it (note that the length of the toothpick of an experiment may vary between one and the number of measurements made). An important feature of an experiment with the BDC is the amount and length of toothpicks generated. The figure below shows the result of an experiment conducted with a BDC of six processing nodes, in which four measurements were made, containing three toothpicks of length one, a toothpick of length two and one toothpick of length four.

1488;Magic Numbers?;Mathematics;8;"""Os números sempre desempenharam um papel de acentuado relevo não só nos altos campos da Fé e da Verdade, como no humílimos terreiros da Superstição e do Erro."" (Prof. Marão)

                Malba Tahan, in his classic ""The Man Who Counted"", tells a tale of superstition involving the quadripartite numbers. Little did he know that centuries before the ancient Czech civilization superstition surrounding the quadripartite numbers was already present. In the antiquity, an important community living around Neratovice, used the properties of the quadripartite numbers to predict the future, baptize children and even to choose their leaders.

                An integer n is quadripartite if there is some division of that number in four parcels integer (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = n) and an magical operator (m) so that the first portion added to the magical operator, the second reduced by it, the third multiplied by it and the fourth divided by it gives the same result (p1 + m = p2 − m = p3 * m = p4 / m).

                Thus, 128 is quadripartite because we can divide 128 into four parts (31, 33, 32 and 32) so that exists a magical operator (in this case, 1) that makes p1 + m, p2 − m, p3 * m e p4 / m equal. In fact: 31 + 1 = 33 - 1 = 32 * 1 = 32 / 1 = 32.

                A group of researchers from Prague is reconstructing the past of Neratovice, and asked for your help.

Eager to impose changes that are noted by the directorate, Wander decided to adopt pair programming in the next big project that he will manage.

Starting with the well known 8-queens problem, several generalizations and variations were made. One of them is the N-rooks problem, which consists of placing N rooks in an N by N chessboard in such a way that they do not attack each other.

Professor Anand presented the N-rooks problem to his students. Since rooks only attack each other when they share a row or column, they soon discovered that the problem can be easily solved by placing the rooks along a main diagonal of the board. So, the professor decided to complicate the problem by adding some pawns to the board. In a board with pawns, two rooks attack each other if and only if they share a row or column and there is no pawn placed between them. Besides, pawns occupy some squares, which gives an additional restriction on which squares the rooks may be placed on.

1491;Blogger Language;Strings;10;"Benjamin’s granddaughter Brenda has a blog where she posts articles about school, friends and other life issues. Intrigued by her opinions, Benjamin tried to read it, but very soon he realized it was too hard to read because of Brenda’s writing quirks.

Brenda writes without spaces or punctuation marks, and moreover, she uses lower and uppercase letters in a liberal and strange way. For example, one of her posts is “PrOgRAMmINgiSgrEAt”. Benjamin has trouble noticing the words “programming”, “is” and “great” when they are written in this way.

To improve his understanding Benjamin decided to do the following: he will first choose a particular string T and a blog post he is interested in; then he will select a contiguous substring of the post and search for T within the substring, in a case-insensitive way; for each occurrence of T within the substring, he will calculate the number of case mismatches, and finally he will obtain the maximum among all these values. For example, if Benjamin chooses “GR” as T and then selects the substring “PrOgRAM”, he would find a single occurrence “gR” for which the number of case mismatches is 1. For the same substring, if “r” was chosen as T, he would have found two occurrences, “r” with 0 mismatches and “R” with 1 mismatch, so the maximum number of mismatches would be 1.

To complicate things further, Brenda included in the blog a script that, after operating with a substring selection, flips the case of all the selected letters. This means that after selecting “PrOgRAM” and proceeding as explained above, the sample post would read “pRoGrammINgiSgrEAt”. If Ben- jamin selects “ammINgi” as a second substring, after calculating his result the post would be left as “pRoGrAMMinGISgrEAt”, accumulating both flips.

As there are no pumps, each pipe carries water from a city to another city at a lower altitude, using gravity. Nlogonia’s water system has been a source of worries for the Queen, because since cities depend on other cities for their water supply, hot discussions occur about how much water a city is allowed to use. A water supply path is a sequence of cities in decreasing order of altitude, starting in Logville and such that there is a pipe connecting each pair of consecutive cities in the sequence.

1498;Inverting Huffman;Graph;10;"Static Huffman coding is an encoding algorithm used mainly for text compression. Given a text of certain size made of N different characters, the algorithm chooses N codes, one for each different character. The text is compressed using these codes. To choose the codes, the algorithm builds a binary rooted tree having N leaves. For N ≥ 2 the tree can be built as follows.
1. For each different character in the text build a tree containing just a single node, and assign to it a weight coincident with the number of occurrences of the character within the text.
2. Build a set s containing the above N trees.
3. While s contains more than one tree:
(a) Choose t1 ∈ s with minimum weight and remove it from s.
(b) Choose t2 ∈ s with minimum weight and remove it from s.
(c) Build a new tree t with t1 as its left subtree and t2 as its right subtree, and assign to t the sums of the weights of t1 and t2.
(d) Include t into s.
4. Return the only tree that remains in s.
For the text “abracadabra”, the tree produced by the above procedure can look like the one on the left of the following picture, where each internal node is labeled with the weight of the subtree rooted at that node. Notice that the obtained tree can also look like the one on the right of the picture, among others, because at steps 3a and 3b the set s may contain several trees with minimum weight.For each different character in the text, its code depends on the path that exists, in the final tree, from the root to the leaf corresponding to the character. The length of the code is the number of edges in that path (which is coincident with the number of internal nodes in the path). Assuming the tree on the left was built by the algorithm, the code for “r” has length 3 while the code for “d” has length 4.

The goal of the game is to position the character at any of the cells that constitutes the border of the map, and make him go to the middle of map, marked with a x. The rules to move in the game follow the arrows logic: The character can only move at the direction that the arrow points.

Consider that initially, all the players are part of a guild, containing only the player itself. The union between two guilds makes all the players from both guilds be part of an unique guild, and the other no longer exists.

Given a list of actions in the game, between them union between two guilds and battles between two guilds, say the number of times that the guild in which Rafael is part was victorious of a battle.";"There will be several test cases.

1528;Entangled Ropes;Ad-Hoc;10;"Four children are playing holding two ropes. Initially, the children are positioned in the four corners of a square, numbered 1 to 4 as shown below:



In the beginning of the play, the children in positions 1 and 4 hold a rope, and the children in positions 2 and 3 hold the other rope. Then the children perform a sequence of movements that can be of three types:


	Movement + : Children in positions 1 and 2 switch places, and the child at position 2 pass the rope over the child at position 1.
	Movement - : Children in positions 1 and 2 switch places, and the child at position 1 pass the rope over the child at position 2.

John Conway is one of the children participating in the game. He is a very smart boy and decided to give you a hint to solve the problem: after the sequence of movements, the ropes can not be completely separated if and only if the sequence of movements is equivalent to a sequence of alternating movements. A sequence of movements is alternating if it switches the '+' and '-' movements between a movement of '*', using the format ""+++...+++*---...---*+++..."". For example, ""+++"", ""-*++*-"" and ""+++*----*"" are alternating sequences. An alternating sequence is always started by a movement of '+' or '-', and don't have consecutives ""*"" movements, so sequences ""*---*++"" and ""++**-"" not are alternating. The sequence ""+-++*+"" is not alternating, but is equivalent to the alternating sequence ""+*-*"", because the two sequences leave the two ropes in the same situation.";The input consists of several test cases.

This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.

You are given the current location of Don Giovanni (which is also the location of Masetto and the villagers), and the current location of Leporello, in two separate lines. Each line has two numbers: the Street number and the Avenue number. You can assume that the roads are regular square grids, with rows as streets numbered from one starting from the northmost, and columns as avenues numbered from one starting from the westmost. Therefore the distance between adjacent streets and avenues is always the same.

1576;The Skyline Problem;Ad-Hoc;9;"With the advent of high speed graphics workstations, CAD (computer-aided design) and other areas (CAM, VLSI design) have made increasingly effective use of computers. One of the problems with drawing images is the elimination of hidden lines — lines obscured by other parts of a drawing.
You must design a program to assist an architect in drawing the skyline of a city given the locations of the buildings in the city. To make the problem tractable, all buildings are rectangular in shape and they share a common bottom (the city they are built in is very ﬂat). The city is also viewed as two-dimensional. A building is speciﬁed by an ordered triple (Li, Hi, Ri) where Li and Ri are left and right coordinates, respectively, of building i and Hi is the height of the building. In the diagram below buildings are shown on the left with triples

One of the most ancient and most important theorems in History, the Pythagorean Theorem states that, in any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the catheti. The Theorem has several applications and is the base of many results in Mathematics, Engineering, Physics and Computer Science. Although the Theorem takes Pythagoras's name, it is believed that babylonian mathematicians, even more ancient, had yet knowledge of the formula.

For example, (3, 4, 5), (6, 8, 10) and (5, 13, 12) are pythagorean triples, because 52 = 32 + 42, 102 = 62 + 82 and 132 = 52 + 122. However, triple (6, 8, 10) is just triple (3, 4, 5) multiplied by 2, and, for that, we say that (6, 8, 10) is not a primitive pythagorean triple.

The user is supposed to, then, without untouching the finger off the screen, slide it through the buttons in order to draw his previously recorded unlock pattern and, thus, unlock the phone to be used.

1586;Tug of War;Strings;6;"At 2013 ACM ICPC Regional South America/Brazil Contest in Uberlândia, during a period of leisure, Prof. Carlinhos (USP) came up with an activity for all the students. He first organised the students in ascending lexicographical order, considering only the first name and ignoring diacritics. Then, he drew a student and assembled two teams, A and B: team A would consist of those students in order up to the drawn student; team B would in turn consist of those students who came after the drawn student in the order. Both teams would compete in a traditional tug of war, and the winners would win a coffee.

Many curious things Prof. Carlinhos realised that day:


	The strength of each student, when placed right in front the adversary (position 1), was exactly equal to the sum of the values corresponding to the characters in ASCII table of the first name of student. Thus, the strength of student Leandro, if placed in position 1 of a team (no matter A or B), would be equal to:


709 = 76 + 101 + 97 + 110 + 100 + 114 + 111 = ‘L’ + ‘e’ + ‘a’ + ‘n’ + ‘d’ + ‘r’ + ‘o’


	The farther from adversary team, less intimidated — and, in consequence, stronger — a student gets. More specifically, a student in position 2 of a team was twice stronger than he or she would be if had been placed in position 1. In position 3, three times etc. Positions of both teams are counted starting the counting in 1 at the closest position to the adversary team. For example, if student Leandro was placed in position 3 of a team, he would have strength equal to 3 × 709 = 2127.
	The strength of a team was equal to the sum of the strengths of all its team members. Nevertheless, if the strength of team A was greater than the strength of team B, team A certainly would win. However, if it was less than, team B certainly would. Finally, if both strengths were equal, the teams would be tied.

Longing to defeat the hegemony of the biggest water park in town, a local IT company, named NCC (Núcleo de Computação Cearense), has built a water park even bigger, named BIT Park, which is going to be opened this year. For the opening the entire population of the city was invited, and NCC promises many activities in order to entertain the people the whole afternoon.

                    One of the scheduled activities for the opening is going to be placed at the biggest pool in BIT Park: a huge game of waterfootball, in which all inhabitants of Fortaleza will be able to participate, since the referred pool has width and length of nothing more, nothing less than 1 km and 2 km, respectively. Waterfootball works roughly as usual football (a.k.a. soccer), but with some differences:

                    
                    	the game takes place inside the water, so, the ball is passed with the hands, rather than with feet;
                    	the game can be played by any even number of players, as long as there is the same number of players in both teams — and as long as all players fit in the pool;
                    	there is no goalkeeper, since every player can defend the ball with the hands;
                    	as in usual football, the validity of a player's position is judged according to the line parallel to the adversary goal line where the player is, considering also the lines where the adversary player are: the position of a player J — and thereafter the player oneself — is considered offside if less than 2/11 of the adversary players are in lines closer to the adversary goal line than the line where J is;

The decision then was to leave the game go on, so a program would later rejudge all events and recalculate the final scoreboard. Once an offside player receives the ball, next goal in match must be disregarded, unless the ball leaves the pool. At the beginning of the game, and every time the balls leaves the pool or some goal comes to pass, the referee draws a player — not necessarily offside — and gives the ball to him or her so the game can continue.";"The input consists of several test cases.

1604;Pair-voting in The Board of Gueliz;Paradigms;7;"The neighborhood of Gueliz in Marrakech is now known to be the modern part of the city with many tourist options, restaurants and bars. Few know the formation of the district, in the sixteenth century. Originally the neighborhood, also known as ""New City"" was forming outside the fortress (Medina, the old city). The first new resident won an official permit from the city to build his house, and was responsible for giving new permits. When a street was opened, an inhabitant of the street (up to the first corner formed) was appointed representative of the street along with the first resident. And so it was for all city streets: the residents were representatives of the corners of the streets that were on that corner, so that each stretch of road without corners has exactly two representatives. There is a legend in Gueliz which prevents the formation of blocks (set of houses surrounded by streets). The elders say that once they formed a block in the neighborhood, and when a poor person died his spirit was trapped there forever, haunting the people who lived there. Ever since then they never formed blocks in the district.

                    The board of the Gueliz district is formed by the first resident and representatives of each street. These representatives form committees to analyze the various situations. In committees the counselors are grouped in pairs, and all counselors must participate in exactly one pair. Each pair has one vote and the motion is approved when they reach majority. Each pair should be formed by representatives of counselors streets that are in some corner (or the first resident and representative of his street). Clearly, when the number of counselors is odd is not possible to find a composition of committees involving all councilors. When this occurred, the first resident had one vote alone, and the others should be divided into pairs.

1605;Building Your Own Cafila;Paradigms;2;"Camels have been domesticated and they are used by the Bedouin people for several millennia. There are two main types, the bactrian camel with two humps, which are rare, and dromedaries, most common, with only one hump. For simplicity, the bactrian camels are called only camels.

                    Dromedary and camels have different interesting characteristics: some are born leaders, others have more strength, others support longer walks, etc. However, each animal has only one of these characteristics. A caravan needs animals with several of these characteristics. In the market of these animals N1 different characteristics for dromedary and N2 different characteristics for camels are considered.

                    The Bedouins always sell these animals in cafilas formed by groups of three. This is a Berber tradition that dates back to the ninth century, when traders of camels and dromedaries could only sell their animals that way. Buyers can not choose the animals. Lots of 3 animals are prepared by the seller and the buyer can just say the batch number that he wants to buy, no more information about it is given. Traders are known for their extreme honesty, and each batch is formed randomly. For each animal of the batch, the dealer draws with probability p1 if it will be a dromedary and with probability p2 = 1 - p1 if it will be a camel, p1 ≥ p2. Chosen the type of animal, a characteristic is chosen from among the Ni, with equal probability, and an animal with this characteristic is included in the batch.

                    All sweepstakes of the trader are independent, a batch can contain two strong droomedaries and a leader camel, for example, or even three good walking camels. However, attest to his honesty, whenever the dealer produces a batch that has only dromedaries he makes a new draw.

1620;Delaunay Triangulation;Mathematics;4;"In mathematics, a Delaunay triangulation for a set of points P on the plane is a DT (P) where no point in P is inside the circumference formed by any triangle in DT (P). The Delaunay triangulation maximizes the smallest angle of all triangles in the triangulation; this tends to avoid triangles with very small internal angles.

                    The triangulation was invented by Boris Delaunay in 1934 for a set of points on a line there is no Delaunay triangulation (the concept of triangulation is broken for this case). For four or more points on the same circle (ie, the vertices of a rectangle) the Delaunay triangulation is not unique: each of the two possibilities of triangulation that divides the quadrilateral into two triangles satisfy the ""Delaunay condition"", ie that the circumferences of all triangles have hollow interiors. Whereas the circles are spheres, the notion of Delaunay triangulation extends to three dimensions. Generalizations are possible for different metrics of Euclidean. However, in these cases it can not guarantee the existence or uniqueness of the Delaunay triangulation.

                    	In each round, the dealer prepares a chessboard with any positive number of white pieces and a single black king, provided that no white king is placed at the board. The number of pieces of each kind is not limited as in traditional chess, i.e. there is no problem in placing, for example, 63 white pawns and 1 black king.
                    	After setting up the chessboard to a round, the dealer picks one of the other players up, so that each player, except for the dealer himself, is chosen exactly once.
                    	The player must then choose a single white piece and move it as many times as necessary to check the black king. The piece movements are the same as in traditional chess, with the only exception that it is not allowed a pawn to move two squares in its first move.
                    	If the player can guess an optimal choice, which checks the king in a minimal number of moves using a single piece, the dealer must drink a whole shot of tequila at once.

A sequence of integers is encoded by writing the codes of the individual integers of the sequence in the same order as the integers appear in the sequence. The prefix of k additional bits before the binary representation of each integer is needed to be able to decode the encoded integers. So when reading the encoding of a sequence of integers, if we read k-1 zeros followed by a one, it means that there are k bits following which are the binary representation of the next encoded integer.

If we want to shorten the length of the encoding of a sequence of integers, there may be still some room for improvement; we will consider the following two optimizations:


	If there is a prefix which indicates that k bits are following, but there is no integer in the sequence with k bits, we can use this prefix to indicate that k+1 bits are following. If there already was a prefix which indicates that k+1 bits are following, this prefix is not needed anymore, and it can be used to indicate that k+2 bits are following, and so on.
	We can add a leading zero to the binary representation of all integers in the sequence with k bits, which then become integers with k+1 bits, and then the first optimization can be used. This optimization seems especially useful if there are few integers with k bits, but many integers with more than k bits.


When we are minimizing the length of the encoding of a sequence of integers, we only care about how many integers in the sequence have a certain number of bits. Let ci denote the number of integers in a sequence with i bits.

Let us look at the following example: c1 = 2, c2 = 4, c3 = 0, c4 = 1 (which, for example, could correspond to a sequence 2, 1, 3, 8, 0, 2, 3). With the original elias gamma coding, the encoding of the sequence would have length 2 × (1 + 1) + 4 × (2 + 2) + 0 × (3 + 3) + 1 × (4 + 4) = 28. By using optimization 1 we can save 1 bit by using prefix 001 for the integer with 4 bits. Then, we could use optimization 2 and add leading zeros to the integers with 1 bit, making them use 2 bits. Then, we use optimization 1 and use prefix 1 for the integers with 2 bits, prefix 01 for the integer with 4 bits, and we get the new length of 6 × (1 + 2) + 1 × (2 + 4) = 24.

Both optimizations can possibly be used several times. Note that for the second optimization, it is not easy to decide when and how to use it. The goal is to combine these two optimizations in the best possible way, that means we want to find an encoding of a given sequence of integers that has minimum length among all encodings using elias gamma coding with any combination of these two optimizations.";The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer n, (1 ≤ n ≤ 128). The next line contains the values  c1, ..., cn (0 ≤ ci ≤ 10000).

1638;Food Portion Size;Ad-Hoc;9;"The university canteen does not want any student to leave the canteen hungry. Therefore, as long as a student is hungry, he can get another portion of food for free. The canteen uses a fixed food portion size, because it would take too much time to first ask a student how much food he wanted. It can happen that a student doesn't finish his last portion of food and the remainder has to be thrown away.

To minimize costs, the manager of the canteen wants to determine a food portion size S such that the amount of food that is wasted is small, but also the number of times the students have to fetch another portion of food is not too big. Note that these two goals can be conflicting:


	By choosing a very small food portion size, one does not waste food, but simultaneously the number of times the students have to fetch food is big.
	By choosing a large food portion size, one can make sure each student has to fetch only one portion, but at the same time it may happen that a large quantity of food is wasted.


The manager of the canteen has collected data about how many units of food each student eats. The problem to be solved can now be formulated mathematically as follows: Let X be the amount of food that is wasted, and Y the number of times the students go to fetch food. Then, the goal is to minimize A × X + B × Y, where A, B are weights that represent the relative importance of the two opposing goals.

1643;Convert Kilometers to Miles;Paradigms;2;"This year, Bruce Force spends his vacation in Flagstaff, Arizona, where he wants to practice for his next half marathon (a race over 21 km). At his first training he runs to his friend Greedy Gonzales' home which is 21 miles away from Flagstaff.

                    Arriving there, he is very tired and realizes that 21 miles are much more than 21 km. Greedy Gonzales tells him that 21 km equals 13 miles. 21, 13? Bruce realizes immediately that there must be a deeper relation! Both, 13 and 21 are Fibonacci numbers!

                    Fibonacci numbers can be defined as follows:

                    F1 = 1

                    F2 = 2

                    Fn+1 = Fn+Fn-1 for n > 1

                    Bruce has just learned about the Fibonacci number system at his university. Each positive integer x can be written as the sum of different Fibonacci numbers, so this means that there exists numbers k and b1, b2, ..., bk such that x = ∑i=1..k bi * Fi, where bk = 1 and bi (1 ≤ i < k) is either 0 or 1. In short, we can write the representation as: b(x) = (bk, bk-1, ..., b1). To make the representation unique, we require that bi * bi-1 = 0 for all i > 1.

                    For example 21 can be represented as (1,0,0,0,0,0,0) and 13 as (1,0,0,0,0,0) in the Fibonacci system. Bruce notices that one can convert a distance x in kilometers into a corresponding distance y to miles as follows: First, write down x in its Fibonacci system representation b(x). Second, shift the bits of b(x) one position to the right (the last bit is deleted) and get b(y). Third, calculate y from b(y) by evaluating the sum given above.

                    For example, the number 42 written in the Fibonacci system is (1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0). In step two we would shift the bits one position to the right and get (1,0,0,1,0,0,0). In the third step, we would calculate 0*1 + 0*2 + 0*3 + 1*5 + 0*8 + 0*13 + 1*21 = 26.

1644;Decode the Strings;Mathematics;8;"Bruce Force has had an interesting idea how to encode strings. The following is the description of how the encoding is done:

                    Let x1,x2,...,xn be the sequence of characters of the string to be encoded.

                    
                    	Choose an integer M and N pairwise distinct numbers p1,p2,...,pn from the set {1, 2, ..., N} (a permutation of the numbers 1 to N).
                    	Repeat the following step m times.
                    	For 1 ≤ i ≤ N set yi to xpi, and then for 1 ≤ i ≤ N replace xi by yi.
                    

                    For example, when we want to encode the string ""hello"", and we choose the value M = 3 and the permutation 2, 3, 1, 5, 4, the data would be encoded in 3 steps: ""hello"" -> ""elhol"" -> ""lhelo"" -> ""helol"".

                    Bruce gives you the encoded strings, and the numbers M and p1, ..., pn used to encode these strings. He claims that because he used huge numbers m for encoding, you will need a lot of time to decode the strings. Can you disprove this claim by quickly decoding the strings?";The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two numbers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 80, 1 ≤ M ≤ 109).

1653;Expressions;Graph;3;"Arithmetic expressions are usually written with the operators in between the two operands (which is called infix notation). For example, (x + y) * (z - w) is an arithmetic expression in infix notation. However, it is easier to write a program to evaluate an expression if the expression is written in postfix notation (also known as reverse polish notation). In postfix notation, an operator is written behind its two operands, which may be expressions themselves. For example, x y + z w - * is a postfix notation of the arithmetic expression given above. Note that in this case parentheses are not required.
                    To evaluate an expression written in postfix notation, an algorithm operating on a stack can be used. A stack is a data structure which supports two operations:
                    1. push: a number is inserted at the top of the stack.
                    2. pop: the number from the top of the stack is taken out.
                    During the evaluation, we process the expression from left to right. If we encounter a number, we push it onto the stack. If we encounter an operator, we pop the first two numbers from the stack, apply the operator on them, and push the result back onto the stack. More specifically, the following pseudocode shows how to handle the case when we encounter an operator O:
                    a := pop();
                    b := pop();
                    push(b O a);
                    The result of the expression will be left as the only number on the stack.
                    Now imagine that we use a queue instead of the stack. A queue also has a push and pop operation, but their meaning is different:
                    1. push: a number is inserted at the end of the queue.
                    2. pop: the number from the front of the queue is taken out of the queue.

1659;Economic Phone Calls;Paradigms;7;"The phone you bought a long time ago has a built-in memory that keeps track of all the calls you receive. It logs the date (month and day) and the time (hour and minute) of each call along with the caller's number. Only a limited number of calls can be logged (memory was still expensive then).

                    You discover that the limit is almost reached and therefore plan to delete some entries from the log. In choosing the entries to delete you have to consider two restrictions:

                    
                    	There are some (important) entries you want to keep.
                    	You want to be able to recover the year (which the phone does not log) of each call you keep. The recovery procedure is described below.
                    

                    Calculate the minimal number of entries that must be kept to satisfy these requirements.

                    Given a list of timestamps (consisting of month, day, hour, and minute) of calls, you find out the year of each call by the following procedure:

                    
                    	The last call in the list occurred in the current year.
                    	You compare its timestamp T to the timestamp T' of the previous call. If T' < T, you assume that both calls occurred in the same year. If T' ≥ T, you assume that the previous call occured the year before.
                    	You iterate backwards through the list and reason as in 2. at each step.

1660;Flavius Josephus Reloaded;Mathematics;6;"Flavius Josephus once was trapped in a cave together with his comrade soldiers surrounded by Romans. All of Josephus' fellow soldiers preferred not to surrender but to commit suicide. So they all formed a circle and agreed on a number K. Every K-th person in the circle would then commit suicide. However, Josephus had different priorities and didn't want to die just yet. According to the legend he managed to find the safe spot in the circle where he would be the last one to commit suicide. He surrendered to the Romans and became a citizen of Rome a few years later.

                    It is a lesser known fact that the souls of Josephus and his comrades were all born again in modern times. Obviously Josephus and his reborn fellow soldiers wanted to avoid a similar fiasco in the future. Thus they asked a consulting company to work out a better decision scheme. The company came up with the following scheme:

                    
                    	For the sake of tradition all soldiers should stand in a circle. This way a number between 0 and N-1 is assigned to each soldier, where N is the number of soldiers.
                    	As changing numbers in the old scheme turned out to be horribly inefficient, the number assigned to a soldier will not change throughout the game.
                    	The consulting company will provide two numbers A and B which will be used to calculate the number of the next soldier as follows: Let X be the number of the current soldier, then the number of the next soldier is the remainder of A·X2< + B mod N.
                    	We start with the soldier with number 0 and each soldier calculates the number of the next soldier according to the formula above.
                    	As everyone deserves a second chance a soldier will commit suicide once his number is calculated for the second time.
                    	In the event that the number of a soldier is calculated for the third time the game will end and all remaining soldiers will surrender.

Interestingly, demand and supply is always the same, so that each inhabitant gets what he wants.

                    There is one problem, however: transporting wine from one house to another results in work. Since all wines are equally good, the inhabitants of Gergovia don't care which persons they are doing trade with, they are only interested in selling or buying a specific amount of wine. They are clever enough to figure out a way of trading so that the overall amount of work needed for transports is minimized.

In this problem, you get the chance to help the problem setter to create some input for a certain problem.

                    For this purpose, let us select the problem which was not solved during last year's local contest. The problem was about finding the optimal binary search tree, given the probabilities that certain nodes are accessed. Your job will be: given the desired optimal binary search tree, find some access probabilities for which this binary search tree is the unique optimal binary search tree. Don't worry if you have not read last year's problem, all required definitions are provided in the following.

                    Let us define a binary search tree inductively as follows:

                    
                    	The empty tree which has no node at all is a binary search tree;
                    	Each non-empty binary search tree has a root, which is a node labelled with an integer, and two binary search trees as left and right subtree of the root;
                    	A left subtree contains no node with a label ≥ than the label of the root;
                    	A right subtree contains no node with a label ≤ than the label of the root;

                    Start with the root node. Compare the label of the current node with the desired label. If it is the same, you have found the right node. Otherwise, if the desired label is smaller, search in the left subtree, otherwise search in the right subtree.

                    The access cost to locate a node is the number of nodes you have to visit until you find the right node. An optimal binary search tree is a binary search tree with the minimum expected access cost.";"The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), the number of nodes in the optimal binary search tree. For simplicity, the labels of the nodes will be integers from 1 to n. The following n lines describe the structure of the tree. The i-th line contains the labels of the roots of the left and right subtree of the node with label i (or -1 for an empty subtree). You can assume that the input always defines a valid binary search tree.

Make sure that you do not write any integer bigger than 263 - 1 (the maximum value fitting in the C/C++ data type long long or the Java data type long).

                    This way, a value for P can be calculated. This value depends on the choice of the assignment of boolean values to the proposition symbols. If P contains n different proposition symbols, there are 2n different assignments. To evaluate all possible assignments we may use truth tables.

                    A truth table contains one line per assignment (i.e., 2n lines in total). Every line contains the values of all subformulas under the chosen assignment.

1671;Code;Graph;7;"KEY Inc., the leading company in security hardware, has developed a new kind of safe. To unlock it, you don't need a key but you are required to enter the correct n-digit code on a keypad (as if this were something new!). There are several models available, from toy safes for children (with a 2-digit code) to the military version (with a 6-digit code).

                    The safe will open as soon as the last digit of the correct code is entered. There is no ""enter"" key. When you enter more than n digits, only the last n digits are significant. For example (in the 4-digit version), if the correct code is 4567, and you plan to enter the digit sequence 1234567890, the door will open as soon as you press the 7 key.

                    The software to create this effect is rather simple. In the n-digit version the safe is always in one of 10n-1 internal states. The current state of the safe simply represents the last n-1 digits that have been entered. One of these states (in the example above, state 456) is marked as the unlocked state. If the safe is in the unlocked state and then the right key (in the example above, 7) is pressed, the door opens. Otherwise the safe shifts to the corresponding new state. For example, if the safe is in state 456 and then you press 8, the safe goes into state 568.

                    A trivial strategy to open the safe is to enter all possible codes one after the other. In the worst case, however, this will require n * 10n keystrokes. By choosing a good digit sequence it is possible to open the safe in at most 10n + n - 1 keystrokes. All you have to do is to find a digit sequence that contains all n-digit sequences exactly once.

The second character is the value of the repeated character. A sequence of more than 9 identical characters is dealt with by first encoding 9 characters, then the remaining ones.

Any sequence of characters that does not contain consecutive repetitions of any characters is represented by a '1' character followed by the sequence of characters, terminated with another '1'. If a '1' appears as part of the sequence, it is escaped with a '1', thus two '1' characters are output.";The input consists of letters (both upper- and lower-case), digits, spaces, and punctuation.

Each contestant got a number starting with 2 for the first one, 3 for the second one, 4 for the third one, and so on, consecutively.

                    The first contestant in the queue was asked for his number (which was 2). He was freed from the washing up and could party on, but every second contestant behind him had to go to the kitchen (those with numbers 4, 6, 8, etc). Then the next contestant in the remaining queue had to tell his number. He answered 3 and was freed from assisting, but every third contestant behind him was to help (those with numbers 9, 15, 21, etc).

1678;Fixed Partition Contest Management;Ad-Hoc;10;"A technique used in early programming contest strategies involved partitioning the available intellectual capacity of a team into a number of members with each member having a fixed amount of intelligence, different members potentially having different amounts. The sum of the brightness of all members equals the total intellectual capacity of the team.

                    Given a set of problems, it was the task of the team to assign the problems to different team members, so that they could be solved concurrently. This was made difficult due to the fact that the solution time of a problem might depend on the amount of intelligence available to it. Every problem has a minimum intelligence requirement, but if assigned to a brighter member its solution time might increase or decrease.

                    In this task, you have to determine optimal assignments of problems to team members. Your program is given the intellectual capacities of the team members available for the solution of problems, and for each problem a description of how its solution time depends on the amount of intelligence available to it. Your program has to find the solution schedule of the problems that minimizes the average solution time for the problems. A solution schedule is an assignment of problems to team members and times, such that no two problems use the same member at the same time, and no problem is assigned to a team member with less brightness than its minimum requirement. The solution time of the problem is the difference between the time when the problem was submitted to be solved (which is the start of the contest at time zero for all problems in this task), and the time that the problem is solved.";"The input data will contain multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing a pair of integers m and n. The number m specifies the number of team members (1 ≤ m ≤ 3), and n specifies the number of problems to be solved (1 ≤ n ≤ 10).

                    The next line contains m positive integers giving the intelligence amounts of the m team members. Following this are n lines, describing the time-brightness tradeoffs for each of the n problems. Each line starts with a positive integer k (k ≤ 10), followed by k pairs of positive integers s1,t1,s2,t2,...,sk,tk that satisfy si < si+1 for 1 ≤ i < k. The minimum intelligence requirement of the problem is s1, i.e. it cannot be solved by a member with less intellectual capacity than this number. If the problem is solved by a team member with brightness s, where si ≤ s < si+1 for some i, then its solution time will be ti. Finally, if the problem is solved by a team member with intellectual capacity sk or more, then its execution time will be tk.

                    A pair of zeroes will follow the input for the last test case.

                    You may assume that each problem will be solved in exactly the time specified for the given brightness, regardless of the number of other problems being solved by other team members at the same time.

1679;Drink, on Ice;Computational Geometry;4;"A good drink is always served on ice. That said, the amount of ice is what makes the difference. If it is too much, the drink will be well cooled, however, this is a bit of fraud as there could be less ice (and more Vodka for example). On the other hand, if there is too little ice the drink is warm which is unacceptable. You are to help the bartender, of course neither with mixing nor drinking, but with calculating the expected outcome of such mixtures.

To make things easier, we assume that pure water is mixed with ice in a closed system, i.e., there is no problem with the outside temperature or the warming of the bottle, etc. Therefore, after a some time has passed, the system may be regarded as balanced (there is no further change in temperature and no more melting or freezing). Your job is to calculate the final temperature of this balanced system and the amount of ice and water in this equilibrium state.

As you know from physics, it takes 4.19 Joule to heat one gram of water one Kelvin, whereas it takes 2.09 Joule if it is ice. We define the capacities cw = 4.19 J/(g*K) and ci = 2.09 J/(g*K). Melting one gram of ice takes 335 Joule, where the temperature remains constant at zero. We define the constant em = 335 J/g. The total thermal energy of the ice and the water before the experiment is equal to the thermal energy of the final mixture.

The figure below shows the energy of one gram of ice, ice-water-mixture, or water, where the temperature is measured relative to -30 degrees Celsius. The jump at 0 degrees represents the melting of ice to water. The amount of energy gained is proportional to the amount of ice already melted.";The input contains several test cases.

We assume that a sheet of paper is rectangular and only folded along lines parallel to its initially shorter edge. The act of folding along such a line, however, can be performed in two directions: either the surface on the top of the sheet is brought together, or the surface on its bottom. In both cases the two parts of the rectangle that are separated by the folding line are laid together neatly and we ignore any differences in thickness of the resulting folded sheet.

After several such folding steps have been performed we may unfold the sheet again and take a look at its longer edge holding the sheet so that it appears as a one-dimensional curve, actually a concatenation of line segments. If we move along this curve in a fixed direction we can classify every place where the sheet was folded as either type A meaning a clockwise turn or type V meaning a counter-clockwise turn. Given such a sequence of classifications, produce a drawing of the longer edge of the sheet assuming 90 degree turns at equidistant places.";The input contains several test cases, each on a separate line.

In this problem you are given the description of the result of performing several folding steps as in problem E: Edge, i.e., in the unfolded state. Additionally, you know that the length of the sheet in its folded state is exactly the length of 1 stripe (again, we ignore thickness).
Find the minimum number of folding steps necessary to generate the described sheet from an initially flat sheet of paper. Note that performing a folding step may create more than one turn in the result because parts of the sheet already overlay due to previous folding steps. When a step is carried out, however, all overlaying parts of the sheet are affected, i.e., it is not allowed to fold, say, only the top three layers.
Finally, note that every result can be obtained by iterating through the turns in a fixed direction and performing a folding step at each turn, thereby accumulating a 1 stripe long stack of all stripes. If n is the number of turns in the input description, this procedure in fact requires n folding steps, which is not necessarily minimal as can be observed in the sample output.";The input contains several test cases, each on a separate line.

Lake Vostok - about 14000 square kilometers large, up to 650 meters deep, and covered by 3743 meters of ice - was recently discovered on the Antarctic continent. The lake remained under conditions of high pressure and no sunlight for several millions of years. It is believed that ordinary life has evolved to a more efficient form using a genetic code composed of only three bases (the current state of ignorance proclaims the four bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine). Until reasonable names are found, the three bases will be abbreviated as N, O, and P.

Moreover, the genome is single-stranded and directed, i.e., we may see it as a sequence over the alphabet {N,O,P}. Unless risking instability, it is necessary that the genome is a Thue-sequence, due to the Norwegian mathematician A. Thue (1863-1922). Define a subsegment of a sequence to be a connected subsequence, and call two subsegments adjacent if one follows immediately after the other in the sequence. A Thue-sequence is a sequence where no adjacent subsegments are equal. For example, NOPNO is and NOPNPNO is not a Thue-sequence, so that the first may be a genome whereas the second may not.

If you insist only on approximately equal distances though, we get a zone of some kilometers width and about 40000 km length. Not everything in this zone is water.

At the beginning of the game, the three pieces are in fixed locations on the graph. In turn, the players may do a move. A move consists of moving one's own piece along an arrow to a new location on the board. The following constraint is imposed on this: the piece may only be moved along arrows of the same colour as the arrow between the two opponents' pieces.

Because of that, his father is teaching him how to solve expressions written in different forms. The first non-traditional form he learned was the Reverse Polish Notation, a form of writing expressions that interestingly does not need parenthesis. John has a keen interest in RPN expressions, but he thinks he can create his own notation that is even more interesting. That’s why he created the Reversed John’s Notation (RJN).

                John came up with the following recursive definition of a valid RJN expression:

                
                    A single digit is a valid expression. The result of an expression of this form is the value of the digit itself.
                    A binary operator (+, −, * or /), followed by two valid expressions, is a valid expression. The result of the expression is the application of the operator with the arguments reversed. That means + a b means the sum of the two operands, − a b means b − a, * a b means the product of a and b and / a b should be evaluated to floor(b/a).

The substring “30a3” is not a substhreeng because it is not composed entirely of base 10 digits, while the substring “13” is not a substhreeng because 13 is not a multiple of 3.

                    Notice that two substhreengs are considered different if they are different in length or start at a different position, even if the selected characters are the same.

1746;Dividing the Names;Data Structures and Libraries;8;"The Queen of Nlogonia has decided to move the capital of the queendom to a brand new city called Sortonia. The design for the city is an N × N grid consisting of N avenues running in the North-South direction and N streets running in the East-West direction. Thus, each avenue intersects every street, and no two streets or two avenues intersect each other.

                    As the city is almost finished, it is now time to assign names to its streets and avenues. The people of Nlogonia have already voted on the 2×N names that they want to use, but it hasn’t been decided yet which of those will be used for the streets and which for the avenues. The issue is not so simple, because in each crossing there should be a sign identifying the street and the avenue that intersect there, and the Queen has expressly ordered that the letters in these signs ought to be written in gold encrusted with rubies.

                    Being the official Accountant who Counts the Money (ACM), it is your task to find a way to minimize the total number of letters written in the crossings’ signs, for obvious reasons. Luckily, you have thought of a very clever way to achieve this, which is to use abbreviations for the names of the streets and avenues in the signs. The abbreviation for the name of an avenue (respectively a street) is the shortest prefix of its name which is not a prefix of the name of any other avenue (respectively street). Of course, the abbreviation to be used for each name depends on how the set of 2 × N names is split in two disjoint sets of N names to be used for the streets and avenues.

                    For example, consider the case with N = 2 where the four chosen names are “GAUSS”, “GALOIS”, “ERDOS” and “EULER”. If the streets are assigned the names “GAUSS” and “GALOIS”, whereas the avenues are assigned the names “ERDOS” and “EULER”, then the abbreviations would be “GAU” for “GAUSS”, “GAL” for “GALOIS”, “ER” for “ERDOS” and “EU” for “EULER”. With this splitting, the total number of letters to be written in the signs would be 20, as the four intersections would be labeled by “GAU|ER”, “GAU|EU”, “GAL|ER” and “GAL|EU”.

                    However, in the example above it would be more convenient to assign the streets the names “GAUSS” and “ERDOS”, leaving “GALOIS” and “EULER” for the avenues. Then, the abbreviations would be “G” for “GAUSS”, “E” for “ERDOS”, “G” for “GALOIS” and “E” for “EULER”, and the total number of letters to be written in the signs would be just 8 (as the intersections would be labeled by “G|G”, “G|E”, “E|G” and “E|E”).

                    Fortunately, the set of names that has been chosen is such that no name in it is a prefix of some other name in the set, thereby ensuring that the scheme you propose will always be feasible. Can you calculate the minimum number of letters to be written in the signs if you split the names optimally?";The first line contains an integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100) representing both the number of streets and the number of avenues in Sortonia.

1747;Even Distribution;Graph;10;"Endre has lots of nieces and nephews. Once a year, he takes some of them on a trip to an archipelago where a boat company operates two-way services between some pairs of islands. Since Endre and the children can fly and return directly to or from any of the islands, any trip can be described as a non-empty sequence i1, i2,..., in of islands, such that each pair of consecutive islands ij and ij+1 have a boat service between them. The first and the last islands of a trip may or may not be the same island, and the islands may be visited more than once during the trip. 

                    Each island in the archipelago produces a different peculiar variety of candy, and greets its visitors by giving each arriving group a fixed number of pieces of candy. Endre does not like candies himself, but the children eat them all almost instantly. To avoid fights, each time the group arrives to an island and receives candies, he evenly distributes them among the children.

                    You may wonder how Endre always manages to evenly distribute the candies they receive in each island. Well, the answer is actually very simple. Each year, the travel agency sends him the trip plan (the sequence i1, i2,..., in ) beforehand. Since he wants to travel with as many of his nieces and nephews as possible, he calculates the maximum number k of kids he can take on the trip without violating the rule about the even distribution of candy. Notice that each trip plan uniquely determines the number of kids to take.

                    This has been going on for years, and each time Endre ends up taking a different number of kids on the trip. He would like to know how many different numbers of kids he can take on a trip, that is, the number of integers k such that there is a trip plan for which he ends up taking k kids on the trip.

1748;Fence The Vegetables;Computational Geometry;8;"At the early age of 40, Alice and Bob decided to retire. After more than two decades working as examples for networking protocols, game theoretical books and several other texts, they were tired. To remain active, they decided to go into gardening.

                    Alice and Bob planted several vegetable plants in a huge field. After finishing, they realized that their plants needed protection from wild animals, so they decided to build a fence around them. The field is represented as the XY plane, and each vegetable plant as a different point in it. A fence is represented as a polygon in the plane. However, not every polygon is a valid fence.

                    The fence needs to be a single simple polygon with each of its sides parallel to one of the axes. Of course, the polygon must contain all the points representing vegetable plants. A fence too close to the plants or to itself could make it difficult to walk around, so each side of the polygon needs to be at least 1 millimeter away from all plants and all non-adjacent sides.

                    Among all valid fences, Alice and Bob decided to build the one with minimum perimeter, in order to save on fence material. If there are several valid fences with minimum perimeter, they want to build one with minimum area among those, to save time when watering their garden.

                    In the following pictures, several different fences are shown in a field with four vegetable plants represented as circles.

1749;Galaxy Collision;Graph;9;"The Andromeda galaxy is expected to collide with our Milky Way in about 3.8 billion years. The collision will probably be a merging of the two galaxies, with no two stars actually colliding. That is because the distance between stars in both galaxies is so huge. Professor Andrew is building a computational model to predict the possible outcomes of the collision and needs your help! A set of points in the two dimensional plane is given, representing stars in a certain region of the already merged galaxies. He does not know which stars came originally from which galaxy; but he knows that, for this region, if two stars came from the same galaxy, then the distance between them is greater than 5 light years. Since every star in this region comes either from Andromeda or from the Milky Way, the professor also knows that the given set of points can be separated into two disjoint subsets, one comprising stars from Andromeda and the other one stars from the Milky Way, both subsets with the property that the minimum distance between two points in the subset is greater than 5 light years. He calls this a good separation, but the bad news is that there may be many different good separations. However, among all possible good separations there is a minimum number of stars a subset must contain, and this is the number your program has to compute.

                    For example, the picture illustrates a given set of six points.

1750;Help Cupid;Ad-Hoc;6;"Cupid’s job is getting harder, so he is adopting new technologies to help him with his difficult task of matching people into happy couples. He appointed the best programmers in his staff to a new project called Advanced Couples Matching (ACM). For this project, the programmers need to produce an algorithm that takes a set of an even number of N lonely persons and matches them into N/2 couples, such that each person is in exactly one couple.

                    Sadly, the data available about each person is limited. In this modern world, using gender, ethnicity, age or nationality as criteria to form couples is not a sensible option, so the programmers can only use data about the internet connection of each candidate. They decided to focus this stage on time zones. People living in closer time zones are more likely to find time to interact with each other. Thus, the programmers decided to create couples so as to minimize the total time difference.

                    Each time zone is identified by an integer between −11 and 12, inclusive, representing its difference in hours from a particular time zone called Coordinated Universal Time (or UTC). The time difference of two people living in time zones represented by integers i and j is the minimum between |i − j| and 24 − |i − j|. Given a partition of a set of an even number N of candidates into N/2 couples, its total time difference is the sum of the time difference of each couple.

Each of your friends that is climbing the mountain is in some other landmark, and you want to visit all of them. There are tracks that connect pairs of landmarks in such a way that there exists exactly one route (that is, a sequence of consecutive tracks) that goes down from the top of the mountain to each other landmark. To visit two friends in two different landmarks, you may have to go down some tracks, climb others, and go down others again. Going down the mountain is “easy”, so you do not consume energy when you go down through the tracks. But each time you climb a track, you consume a certain amount of energy. After visiting all your friends, you can just sit and rest.

                    You are planning a trip through the kingdom to find out, but the roads are dangerous so you have to be very careful. To go from one province to another you would like to use the convenient escorted carriage system managed by the Interprovincial Communication & Peregrination Company (ICPC). In each province, the ICPC provides a heavily guarded carriage for you to travel to any other province in a rectangle containing it, at the same flat rate (which may however vary from one province to another). More formally, at the province in the i-th row and the j-th column you can rent an escorted carriage for a cost of Vij , allowing you to safely travel to any province at most Rij rows away from row i, and at most Cij columns away from column j (that is, having row number i' and column number j' with |i − i' | ≤ Rij and |j − j' | ≤ Cij ).

                    For today’s meeting, each knight was given a number between 1 and K that indicates the seat he must take during the meeting. Seats are numbered clockwise from 1 to K, seat numbered 1 being the first to the left of the big throne. Obviously, the king himself was not given a number because he sits on the throne. King Arthur’s squire made sure that no two knights got the same number so there should be no problems.

                    As usual, the king was the first to enter the council room today. According to the protocol rules, he sat on his throne and prepared to receive the K knights that must enter and sit one by one. After the first D knights arrived, the king noted that some of them could have sat on wrong seats, because they were distracted talking about who would win the next tournament. What a mess! King Arthur’s squire promptly intervened and gave instructions to the remaining K − D knights. Each of them must enter the council room and try to sit on his rightful seat; if his seat is already occupied, the knight must walk clockwise around the table and sit on the first unoccupied seat he finds. Thus, the final distribution of knights around the table depends on the order in which they enter the room.

1775;Andre and the Mentos;Paradigms;5;"Andre is a programming competitor in CIn-UFPE. Every saturday, during the trainings, he eats and drinks everything: snacks, soda, cookies, water and mentos. Mainly mentos. But the problem, however, is that everytime Andre takes some candies from the tube, he has to stop coding for a while, which disturbs his concentration.

                    The mentos come in a tube with two heads. Each time Andre wants to take some candies, he chooses a certain flavour, and look for both heads of the tube. In each head, if there's a candy with the chosen flavour, he takes it. If there's no candy with that flavour in both heads, he takes none, and has just stopped coding for no reason. To cut his waste of time during the contest, Andre decided to minimize the amount of stops he makes to get candies. He made a fine cut along the tube to be able to see in advance which flavours and in which order the candies are inside the tube. But he's not able to get candies from the middle of the tube, since the cut he made is extremely thin and the only purpose of it is to decide better which flavours he'll take from each of the heads during his stops.

                    Now, Andre needs to calculate the minimum number of times he must stop coding to get his candies, following the described method, until all the candies from the tube are over.

1778;Graph Defense;Graph;9;"Tower Defense is a famous strategy game where the player must place defense towers to protect something - be it a castle, a treasure or even yourself - against a horde of monsters. There are several variations of the game: in some types, the map resembles a board, and the monsters follow a specific path; in other types, the map is open and monsters can reach the final destination by several different paths.

                    Graph Defense is a variation of the common Tower Defense. Here, the map is represented as a graph. Each vertex is a position where a monster or a tower (or both) may be, at any given time, and the edges represent bidirectional connections between these vertices (e.g. if there is an edge from u to v, a monster which is the at the vertex u at a given moment can go to the vertex v at the next moment and vice versa). The castle, which you want to protect, is at the vertex F.

                    Each tower i has a reach Ci, an attack Ai and is positioned at a vertex Vi. All vertices that are a maximum of Ci edges away from Vi receive a damage of Ai at every time unit. The towers do not move, and they exist since the beginning of the game. The castle has a magic shield that makes impossible for other towers to attack the vertex F where it stands, nor propagate the attack, i.e. the vertex F is a barrier and nothing passes through it but the monsters, possibly.

                    Each monster i appears during the game at a vertex Ki, and has Hi life points. The monsters never stand still, and every time unit they move to an adjacent vertex. They will always move towards the final destination along the path that will cause the least damage possible. The monsters die when they reach 0 or less life points. A monster can only invade the castle when it reaches the vertex F alive. If there is a tower that reaches the starting vertex Ki of the monster, it will inflict damage in the first moment when the monster appears. A monster may arise already in the castle.

Daily, several loaded trucks leave from a post of the company (the place where the products are stored) on their way to the consumer centers.

1814;DNA Storage?;Ad-Hoc;7;"Charles University in Prague, by example of several other leading universities around the world, recently established an interdepartmental graduate program in computational biology. Ms. Dolejškova, member of the faculty, is currently interested in the problem of phylogenetic trees, and working with n chains of DNA. To simplify the work, Ms. Dolejškova decided to work only with gene chains of length m (i.e., all the chains have exactly m nitrogenous bases).

                    An interesting sub-problem involves storing the n chains in a disk. Yet, Ms. Dolejškova is using a naive scheme that requires n × m characters, besides the delimiters. I.e., all sequences are written in a text file, sequentially. Mr. Chuchle, a department mate and storage techniques expert, suggested an alternative that may be more economical.

                    According to Mr. Chuchle, you can store a chain and the information that allow it to transform into other. More specifically, consider two chains of DNA D1 = ACTA and D2 = AGTC, where A, C, G, T are the nitrogenous bases adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine, respectively. Note that it is possible to turn D1 into D2 by exchanging the nitrogenous bases C and A of the 2 and 4 positions from D1 to G and C, respectively. Consider now a third chain D3 = CGTC. Only a modification is required to turn D2 into D3 and three changes are required to transform D1 into D3. Thus, is profitable to have the transitivity of the changes between the chains.

                    Ms. Dolejškova quickly observed that alternative storage scheme does not offer gains if the chains involved are very different. Thus, instead of using it promptly, she asked you to build a program that receives n chains, and determines the minimum number of changes that must be written (plus a chain) to make it possible in future to obtain again the original n chains.

                    Recently, czech researchers announced with great excitement to the press the understanding of the encoding mechanism used by those vikings. According to the researchers, the viking alphabet was made by the letters from A to Z (including letters K, W and Y).

Initially, it was built a list where the letter A appear in the first position, the letter B in the second, and so on, with the letters following the same order of our alphabet. Next, the text to be encoded was swept from left to right and, for each letter l found, the number of its position on the list was printed and l was moved to the start of the list. For instance, the viking encoding for the message:

                    The Emperor Po Lop was a great chopsticks collector. Since the age of 9 years, he was keeping them and was building with them huge mazes using a quite interesting strategy. First Po Lop chose a rectangular yard of the forbidden city to build the maze, which always occupied all space of the chosen yard. The chopsticks were then put in the yard, apparently at random places, and always parallel to one of the yard’s corners. The emperor never put chopsticks to overlap (or even part of them), although crossing or even leaning chopsticks are possible. According to his biography, the emperor Po Lop built monstrous mazes always carefully.

                    Unfortunately there was a problem. Although an expert builder of the mazes, the emperor was unable to know if the maze was finally containing a path linking its entrance to the exit (always in opposite sides of the yard) or not. To know that, he was using his eunuchs. He was instructing the eunuch to seek the path that matches. Many times, the eunuch said it was not possible. The emperor Po Lop become angry and beheaded the servant because he doubted on his servant’s answer. Happily, as being very patient (not with eunuchs) the emperor was quite careful and wrote down judiciously the information about the mazes built. His notes were found in the library of the forbidden city when the revolution occurred and were saved from destruction. Your task in this problem is to solve finally the riddle, verifying if the mazes built by Emperor Po Lop have an exit or not.";Your code must be prepared to work with several mazes, from now on designated instance. Each instance is started with one line containing 5 numbers, called  n xi  yi  xf  yf . The value of n indicates the number of chopsticks used for building the maze. The ordered pair ( xi  , yi ) is the left bottom of the yard and the base. The ordered pair ( xf  , yf ) is the right upper and the arrival point. The next n lines give the coordinates  x1  y1  x2  y2  representing the extremes ( x1  , y1 ) and ( x2  , y2 ) of one of the chopsticks used to build the maze. The input file ends with  n   < 0. It can be assumed that all numbers given are integers and that  n   ≤ 1000.;"For each instance resolved, you should print a identifier “Instancia h” (where “Instancia” means “instance” in Portuguese) in which h is a integer number, sequentially growing from 1. In the next line, you should print “sim” (“yes” in Portuguese) if there exists a way to go from the maze’s base to the arrival point (without crossing any chopstick...), and print “nao” (“not” in Portuguese) otherwise.

Unfortunately, not all experiments resulted in success, and in addition to some frogs with no legs and 12 eyes, the experiments yielded several species of frogs with different characteristics of jumps. The goal of this problem is that you develop a program that, from the observation of the pattern of frog jumps, make sure it is of the desired type. The frog is of the desired type if is placed in the upper left corner of a rectangular lake he covers the entire length of the lake with a minimum number of hops.

                	These ants can only travel a straight path and their walking behavior is similar than that of the light. That is, whenever an ant hits a wall it ""relfects"" (as would a light beam when hitting a flat mirror) in such a way that the reflection angle is equal to the incidence angle;
                	These ants only stop when encountering food and keep on moving the same way after it's eaten;
                	The maximum an ant can travel without eating is 2 meters.
                

                In order to prove these conclusions, the scientists built a series of sceneries to test the ants. Each scenery consists of a rectangle with dimensions of M x N meters. Each scenery has four entries, located on each of the vertices, that from now on shall be called by one of the cardinal points, as follows:

                

                Inside the rectangle, MN amounts of food were distributed in the center of each of the 1m x 1m squares contained in the scenery. The ants are inserted into each scenery through one of the four possible entries in a path that makes a 45 degrees angle with both sides of the rectangle conected in that vertex. After walking aproximately 0.707m an ant encounters its first meal and continues following a straight line after eating it until one of the following happens:

                
                	The ant hits a wall, in which case its path is reflected. The resulting path still has an angle of 45 degrees;
                	The ant travels more than 2 meters and finds no food, in which case the poor thing dies...;
                	The ant encounters a door, in which case it goes out of the testing area and the experiment ends.

1826;Is The Language Infinite?;Graph;10;"Context-free grammar – CFG – is a mathematical structure used to generate strings, which are finite sequences of terminal symbols. The set of all strings that can be generated by CFG G is the language of G, written L(G). In this problem, given a CFG G, you must tell if L(G) is an empty set, finite, or infinite.

					A CFG is a 4-tuple (V, Σ, R, S), where

					
						V is a finite and non-empty set whose elements are called variables.
						Σ is a finite and non-empty set, disjoint of V, whose elements are called terminal symbols.
						R is a set of rules. A rule has the form
						A → U1U2...Uk
						where A ∈ V, k ≥ 0 and Ui ∈ V ∪ Σ for i = 1,2,...,k.
						S ∈ V is the start variable.
					

					To generate a string using a CFG, we run the following procedure.

					First, write the start variable S. Next, choose a rule to substitute S, say, S → U1U2...Uk. After this choice, erase the S and write in its place the string of variables and/or terminals U1U2...Uk. Repeat this process until no variable is left written. If it's not possible to generate a string without variables starting with the start variable, we say that the CFG's language is empty.

					For example, let be the CFG below, where S is the start variable.

					S → aSa

					S → bSb

					S → a

					S → b

					S → 

					Using the CFG above, we can generate any palindrome made of a's and b's. For example:

					S → aSa → abSba → abba

					Observe that the empty string is a valid string. So, if a CFG G generates, for example, only the empty string, L(G) is finite, but not empty.

					In this problem, the variables will be words made only of uppercase letters, that is, characters between A and Z. The terminal symbols will be lowercase letters, that is, characters between a and z. The rules will be in the format described in the next section. The start variable will always be the first variable of the test case.";"The input contains many test cases. Each test case describes a context-free grammar.

					This is the 3rd year of the Programming Club, an extension program whose primary goal is to help the programmers of the Brazilian region known as Southern Border to get readier to face the computational challenges from both academic and corporate worlds. Our main strategy lies in promoting workshops and training sessions for Programming contests, not only for students of our institution (UFFS), but also for whoever wants to participate. Despite of many issues, we find ourselves very happy with the results we have been achieving. Having other institutions as partners, as UNOCHAPECÓ, URI and UNOESC, we collaborated to make Chapecó in the past two years the 2nd largest site of ICPC Brazilian Subregional Contest, which is another indicator of the enthusiasm our people has in Programming.

					In order to warm you up for this particular contest, we shall ask you to write a program which calculates the quotient and the remainder of the division of two integers, can that be? Recall that the quotient and the remainder of the division of an integer a by a non-zero integer b are respectively the only integers q and r such that 0 ≤ r < |b| and:

					The Chamber of Secrets is going to be a real maze, so eventual invaders will not exit so easily. But the architects are not sure about the plan and want to make some changes in the project. In order to make the work easier, they have projected the entire plan of the building over a grid of square units, so that each square unit would be either fully wall or free space, as in the figure below.

Worried about maintaining the physical integrity of the prisoners, the police chief intended to transfer them to Azkaban. “They will be safer in the hands of the dementors than in the hands of the people of Chapecó”, he declared while making the arrangements with the Minister of Magic for the transfer, scheduled for the next morning.

					While the prisoners were waiting sleepless for the transfer which would never occur, they decided to play Dammit, a very popular game in Brazil. In one of its many versions, the rules of the game are:

						One of the players deals n cards to each player. Then, this player flips a card on the table, which determines the trumps of the game, which are the cards with rank immediately above the rank of the flipped card in the basic ordering. For example, if a card with rank 7 is flipped, the cards defined as the trumps of the game are Q♦, Q♠, Q♥ and Q♣. If a card with rank 3 is flipped, the trumps are 4♦, 4♠, 4♥ and 4♣.

Then begin the rounds, in each of which each player plays one of his cards revealing it on the table. A player is said to make a round if the card he plays in that round is of greater value than all the other cards played in that round. Since the suits undo a tie only among trumps, it is possible for a round not to be made by any player.

This is a game with words. In this game, it is considered only the Dothraki alphabet, which consists on the first L lowercase letters of the English alphabet.

The game starts with a list of S strings s1, ..., sS. The game is played by turns, and Tyrion begins. At each turn, a player chooses one string from the list and adds a letter (from the Dothraki alphabet) to its end, in the right side.

The snowmen were becoming adorable, except for a detail: none of them had a nose, since the only carrots now remaining in Westeros were in House Stark's royal larder. The king, touched, decided to give some of his carrots away so they could be distributed in rectangular-shaped regions of the Town. But the children of Westeros are greedy and do not mind putting several noses on their snowmen, no matter if other children end up with no noses to put on their snowmen. For example, if the king assigns 2 identical carrots to a region in which there are 3 snowmen, a, b and c, there are 6 possibilities to the distribution of these carrots among the snowmen after the children have stopped fighting against each other:


	a ends up with 2 noses and b and c with none;

Noticing that the fights among the children were leading a considerable number of them to death, and worrying about the future of the kingdom's population, the king decided to choose only one rectangular-shaped region per day, so that the distribution of the carrots were made always at the end of the day, when all the snowmen had already been built. It is not allowed to the children using carrots for snowmen out of the awarded region of the day, not even to take carrots home in order to use them in the next day.

During the excavations, they have discovered that the continent was actually formed geologically by the collision of four continents once separated. They have even been able to discover the names with which the peoples of that age used to call those continents: Westeros, Essos, Sothoryos and Ulthos. However, they are still in the process of identifying the families that used to inhabit the first continent, Westeros, since the promiscuity among the ancient peoples was very big and the records seem too confusing. At the present stage of the project, they are considering that the peoples were divided only in two large families: Stark and Lannister. In the future they intend to divide these families better. For instance, the goal is, given the genetic codes of the fossilised individuals, to classify the individuals in those two families in order to minimise the relations of kinship among individuals classified in different families.

					More formally, we say that an individual X is relative of an individual Y if the genetic codes of both individuals share an identical contiguous part of length at least P% of the length of one of the codes — as all the individuals are humans, the genetic codes have always the same length.

Afterwards, each player plays a card, following clockwise order, until everyone has played. The trick then ends.

				Intrigued by the existence of non palidromic numbers as decorations in the ruins, Renzo found out that, while these numbers are not palindromic when represented in base 10 (which is the base used in the Thai numeral system), they are palindromic when represented in another base.

The organization of Extraordinary Mystery Investigators (IME, in their language) aims to uncover the secrets of this ancient kingdom. One of IME's most notorious historians is Márcio ""the indispensable"" Himura. He is currently researching the laws and punishments in place during King Ramathibodi I's rule. Recent discoveries suggest how Ramathibodi I used to punish the subjects that did not convert to Theravada Buddhism, the religion he adopted.

					The punishment involved trapping the accused prisoner in a room with a single exit and to light up a fire. If the prisoner could manage to reach the exit before getting caught on fire, she or he was forgiven and allowed to live. Márcio has access to some records that describe the floorplans of the rooms where this punishment took place. However, there are no documents asserting whether the prisoners were forgiven. Márcio would like to know whether each of these prisoners had any chance at all of having been forgiven. For that, Márcio represented each room as a grid with N rows and M columns, where each position has a symbol with the following meaning

					
					
					where ""start"" is the person's initial position in the room when fire has been lit up. Moreover, Márcio imposed the following constraints in his model:


	Fire spreads in the four cardinal directions (N, S, E, O) at the speed of one cell per minute.
	The prisoners can also move in these four directions at the same speed.
	Neither fire nor the prisoners can walk through a wall.

However, the referee claimed that Nai Khanom Tom only won because he performed Ram Muay, a ritualistic dance move. The king then ordered Nai to duel ten Burmese warriors, one after another. Nai Khanom Tom still beat them all. Having witnessed Nai's skills, king Mangra set him free.

The ruler demands the lottery to be perfectly fair, that is, each of his subjects must have the same probability of winning. The lottery consists of a finite number of rounds of dice rolls and, after each round, it is either decided that there is a winner or that more rounds are required. The dice rolls must follows the following rules:


	several dice may be rolled at the same round;
	previous rounds may affect the choice of dice in the next rounds;
	the same dice can be rolled in multiple rounds.


It is imperative to ensure that each subject has the same chance of winning the lottery. Notice that this is not always possible. For instance, if there are 5 subjects and a single 6-face die, then it is impossible to have a fair lottery. On the other hand, with such a die one can have a fair lottery if the population size is 3, 6, 18, or 36 people, and so on.

Some historical Thai sites have dozens such structures, dedicated to monks or nuns or other religious leaders (known as bhikkhu - ภิกษุณี in Thailand). For instance, in Kamphaeng Phet some chedi inscriptions refer to Garuda (ครุฑ), and similarly in Si Satchanalai and Sukhothai.

The differences between some Thai symbols are very subtle, making it hard for experts to analyze words. For instance, when any symbol of the word Ramakien (รามเกียรติ์) is changed, its meaning is altered completely. Since many of the sites are over 700 years old, the inscriptions are very worn.

An example is the pair of inscriptions below, found in distinct chedis:

จัดษุตังขึ้นโดยพรภิะบมพุธานุญาษุ

จัดตั้งขึ้โกดยพระบรมษุพุทธานญาต

Experts believe both refer to the same entity. They developed a method to validate their hypothesis; this is called the method of minimum probabilistic difference.

The method works as follows. Let a = a1a2...aN and b = b1b2...bM be two inscriptions with N and M characters, respectively. The parameter called difference is initially set to zero. At each step, we analyze a pair (ai, bj) of characters with 1 ≤ i ≤ N + 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ M + 1, starting with (a1, b1). Note that when i = N + 1, ai is the empty character. The same happens to bj when j = M + 1. If ai = bj, we consider the corresponding characters to match and we update the current pair to (ai+1, bj+1). There is not match if ai ≠ bj and a character from one inscription never matches two characters in the other. If there is no match between the characters of the pair, then we update the difference parameter following one of these rules:


	
	we increment the difference and update the current pair to (ai+1, bj) or (ai, bj+1);
	
	
	we add K to the difference and update the current pair to (ai+x, bj+y), where x and y are chosen randomly with uniform distribution in the intervals [1,N-i+1] and [1, M-j+1], respectively. If i > N, then only x is chosen randomly. If j > M, then only y is chosen randomly.
	


The analysis ends when ai and bj) are both the empty character. Note that the difference parameter may vary with the choices made in the procedure.

You must shoot the ball to some direction. The ball will then follow a straight line on the direction it was shot. The objective of the game is to shoot the ball to such direction that it hits any point of the target.

However, there are also N walls between the ball and the target. The wall i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) is Di meters away from the ball. There is only one opening in each wall. The wall i has an opening beginning Ai meters from the ground and ending Bi meters from the ground.

Of course, the ball must pass through all openings and hit the target. In the case the ball passes exactly at a point an opening starts or ends (i.e., Ai or Bi meters high), consider that the ball successfully pass through the opening.

Depending on the positions of the walls and the openings, it may not be possible to hit the target at all. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to hit the target or not.

Alice and Bob play ‘Odds and Evens 2.0’ all the time. In this version of the game, the players are supposed to show at the same time using the hands an integer between 0 and 10 million. If the numbers shown by both players are equal, we have a tie. Otherwise, the players alternate writing down numbers in a piece of paper. Let A be the integer shown by Alice in the beginning of the match and let B be the integer shown by Bob, each number written down must be a product of |A - B| factors, with all factors being prime numbers, not necessarily distinct, belonging to the interval defined by the integers A and B. Besides, a number is never allowed to be written down more than once. Loses the match the player who happens not to be able of writing down a new number when it is his or her turn to play. As Bob is a gentleman, Alice is always the first to play. Note that if there are no prime numbers in the interval defined by the integers A and B, Alice cannot write down any number in her first turn, and Bob wins the match.

Note that, if A is a possible genetic parent of B, it does not mean that B belongs to the same species as A, for a mutation might has happened during the generation of B. Naturally, we say that an individual A is a possible genetic ancestor of an individual B if there is a sequence of k individuals I1, I1, …, Ik such that I1 = A, Ik = B and, for every j ∈ {1, …, k - 1}, Ij is a possible genetic parent of Ij + 1.

Laura is studying the fossils found last month in Chapecó in order to determine, through the extracted genetic codes, the species that used to live in the region. But the concept of ‘species’ is very controversial. Laura, who does not want to live situations like the one of the madam in the image above, has preferred adopting the following definition: two individuals A and B belong to the same species if and only if A is a possible genetic ancestor of B and B is a possible genetic ancestor of A. The diagram below illustrates a situation with 7 fossilised individuals, in which an arc from an individual A to an individual B represents that A is a possible genetic parent of B. In the example, we can identify 3 species: I, II and III.



Given the informations provided by Laura's program, help her to calculate the number of possible evolutionary paths from the species of an individual S to the species of an individual T. A possible evolutionary path from a species E1 to a species Ek is a sequence of k species E1, E2, …, Ek such that, for every j ∈ {1, …, k - 1}, there is some individual B belonging to the species Ij + 1 which has a possible genetic parent belonging to the species Ij.";The first input line consists of 4 integers, N, M, S e T (1 ≤ N ≤ 105, 0 ≤ M ≤ 106, 1 ≤ S, T ≤ N), wherein N is the number of fossilised individuals, designated by the integers from 1 to N, whose genetic codes have been obtained by Laura. Each one of the M lines following consists of 2 integers, A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N), representing that Laura's program considers the individual A a possible genetic parent of B.;Your program shall output a line containing a single integer, which shall represent the number of possible evolutionary paths from the species to which the individual S belongs to the species to which the individual T belongs.

1955;See World;Graph;5;Under the orientation of Professor Graziela Tonin, the students of Topics on Software Engineering are developing a system to help See World, the new theme park in town, allocate orcas in two huge tanks. The orcas have particularly a very complex social hierarchy, of at least 4 levels, and it is curious that orcas are capable of vocalising different dialects, depending on the level of the social hierarchy by which they are related to their interlocutor. One of the hardest difficulties about maintaining orcas in captivity is that, if two orcas are put together in a same tank but they speak no dialect in common, they will eventually fight, for they do not understand each other and they come from totally different cultures. Sometimes they can suffer severe injuries or even die. Thus, See World wants to allocate its orcas in its two tanks in such a way that, if two orcas are allocated in a same tank, it is guaranteed that they share at least one common dialect.;The first input line consists of an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 103), which represents the number of See World's orcas. By the way, each See World's orca is represented singly by a single code between 1 and N.

1956;Acacias;Graph;6;"Perhaps you don't know it, but not all elves have been gone away to Valinor. There are legends according to which some noldor live in an acacia forest to the north of Chapecó, although no mortal man has ever seen them, for over their houses lies an invisibility enchantment sung by Lady Galadriel just before she takes the last boat to the Immortal Lands. Each house has been built on the top of an acacia, and there are many elven robe bridges connecting pairs of houses, satisfying the following ancient tradition: if two elves belong to the same family but live in different houses, then it is possible to go from the house where one lives to the house where the other lives taking a path consisting only of elven robe bridges. Conversely, if two elves do not belong to the same family, they do not live in the same house, and any way of going from one's house to the other's mandatorily has to pass by the floor.

The Earth has already faced terrible threats, as the threat of Morgoth and the threat of Sauron. However, none is comparable to the threat that the men are being to the Earth by themselves. For the other day a careless smoker threw a cigarette end near the acacia forest and the fire spread. The elves got to save their houses, but all the bridges were destroyed. Now, they want to rebuild the bridges, but not all of them, since the elven robes made by the ancient noldor are very precious to them. They want to rebuild only the bridges which really are needed for the previously mentioned tradition to be satisfied again, and using as less as possible of elven robe.

However, yesterday afternoon he and his girlfriend had a bad fight and ended up breaking up, which pissed him off. As he had classes at night, he decided to go to the university on foot, in order to unwind a bit. When arriving at the campus, he stopped in front of the UFFS's obelisk and instantly resolved he would not use his wrath for hatred, but for love: he would be there standing still until a woman passed by him, with whom, asking her out, he would try to rebuild his life. If more than one woman passed by him at the same time, Khan would choose the prettiest.

UFFS campus in Chapecó is surrounded by a road, to which one can come through a single access road from the city of Guatambu, since the former access road has been disabled. As figure above illustrates, it is right in the intersection between the access and the surrounding road that lies the UFFS's obelisk, represented in the figure by the symbol *.

1965;The Search for Spock;Ad-Hoc;10;"‘Coxinha’ is the name given to a traditional Brazilian food which consists of shredded chicken meat covered in dough and fried. Recently Mr. Spock, the chef of Enterprise, a restaurant in Chapecó, has won an important gastronomy award, for making the most delicious coxinhas in the world. You should try a Mr. Spock's coxinha. They are so amazing that the flavour will boldly take you to where no man has gone before. But it is not easy to get a coxinha in Enterprise. The search for Spock is such that it is needed to place an order at least 42 days earlier.

Mr. Spock likes to make coxinhas of different sizes and shapes. In order to shape a coxinha, he first picks up at least two circular bottomless pans of same height but diameters all distinct. Then he puts one pan over the other in decreasing order of diameter from the base to the top, tying them with a string on the side. Finally, he uses the pans to shape his coxinha. The first and the second figures show the pan structure as seen respectively from above and from the front. The third and the forth figures show the resulting coxinha, also as seen respectively from above and from the front.



Aiming to better serve his clients, Enterprise also offers delivery service. Something important that Mr. Spock has found out is that, if he does not want the coxinhas to lose their flavour and crunchiness, he must put them in the packet sequentially, one after the other, always reclined in a manner that the bases stay perfectly perpendicular to the bottom of the packet. Further, consecutive coxinhas in the sequence must always have either their bases or their tops touching, and the touching parts must always have the same diameter. Coxinhas whose tops point to the left are called ‘left coxinhas’, those whose tops point to the right are called ‘right coxinhas’, and Mr. Spock uses the coxinhas orientation so the client can know the type of seasoning in the filling of each one. No matter the size, two coxinhas are sold by the same price if and only if either both are left coxinhas or either both are right. There is always at least one left coxinha and at least one right coxinha in a packet. The figure below illustrates a packet (dashed lines) containing 4 coxinhas (continuous lines). As you can see, the coxinhas always fit perfectly in the packet.



You have been hired to work in Enterprise quality control team. Your function is to take the already full packets, pass them through an X-ray scanner and, based on the measurements reported by the scanner, determine how many left and how many right coxinhas there are in the packets. The measurements are made from the left to the right, at a spacing identical to the height of the pans used in the shaping of the coxinhas. In each measurement it is reported the height of the coxinha inside the packet at that point, but only if the result of the measurement is different from the result of the previous measurement (otherwise, nothing is reported). In the figure above, 14 measurements are illustrated by the dotted lines. Note that only 10 of them are reported.

As you are new in the team, your colleagues have hidden from you the coxinhas prices and they want you not only to calculate how many left and how many right coxinhas there are in the packet, but also to guess the price of left coxinhas and the price of right coxinhas. For this purpose, they have told you the total price of the coxinhas in the packet, the difference between the two prices and the type of the coxinhas which are more expensive.";"Three lines make the input.

1968;The Undiscovered Country;Mathematics;10;"Last October 12th we celebrated in Brazil the Children's Day. We adults should live more in children's world, for the opposite is not working, not at all. We adults have split the world into nations, and the children are those who suffer the most from the wars. We adults have built a wealth distribution system, and the children are those who suffer the most from hunger. But there is an Undiscovered Country, not so far from those who still preserve a little bit of imagination, that belongs to the children. There is no war there, or poverty, or hunger. There the children play day and night.

But a catastrophe is happening to the Undiscovered Country. A catastrophe! The sheep which used to live in the Undiscovered Country have ended up getting old, or sick, or swallowed by boa constrictors. This way, the baobabs have started to grow and spread over the entire country. Now, the citizens have to move urgently. In order to facilitate the evacuation, all the citizens have been numbered from A to B (it is obvious that this idea has come from the adults — they love these things!). In order to define who would be the leaders of the groups during the evacuation, someone has suggested that the leaders should be all those who have received a prime number (it is obvious that this idea has come from a child — children have a lot of imagination and they love pleasing themselves with things that need no further explanation!). But soon another idea came forth:

— A prime number is a number that has exactly 2 divisors. What if the leaders were those who have received a number with exactly N divisors?

All the children loved the idea. The adults, on the other hand, needed a long time to debate how the number N should be chosen. When finally the number N was chosen, each citizen who were not leader of a group should pick up the group he or she liked the most to enter it. No other restriction was imposed to the groups. Nothing was preventing, for example, a group of consisting only of its leader. Note that, depending on the value of N, there would not be any group at all.

Knowing the values of A, B and N, release the child inside you and try to figure out the total number of possibilities for the formation of the groups. If, for example, A = 5, B = 8 and N = 4, situation in which the leaders are the citizens 6 and 8, there are 4 possibilities:

1969;Generations;Mathematics;10;"It is not possible yet to build a machine that allows time travel to a body made of matter. However, the physicist Asdrubal Keyla Monteiro has already developed a machine able to send messages through time, communicating with generations of the future. Theoretically it would be also possible to use this machine to send messages to generations of the past, but they would not have the technology to receive those messages. Each message is a binary sequence of a fixed length settled by the generation with which A. K. M. is communicating. The end of each message is always marked by 11, a pattern that obviously cannot happen in any other place of the message, otherwise the message would arrive truncated at its destination. For example, if the message length settled by the generation with which A. K. M. is communicating is 6, there are 5 possibilities for the message sent to that generation:

000011      001011      010011      100011      101011

The interesting thing about this communication protocol is that, by concatenating the messages it is possible to enter a single file into the machine so that the machine sends a message to each one of a specified set of generations. For example, if A. K. M. wants to communicate with the generations registered in the machine respectively as 1, 2 and 3, and if the message lengths settled by the generations are respectively 3, 5 and 3, there are 3 possibilities for the file that can be entered into the machine:

01100011011      01101011011      01110011011

The machine developed by A. K. M. only sends messages. For now, it is not possible to receive messages from the future. The only thing possible to receive from a generation of the future is the message length information. Often the generations update this value, and A. K. M. needs to be alert.";"The first input line consists of two integers, G e E (1 ≤ G, E ≤ 105), which represent respectively the number of generations registered in the machine and the number of events described in the input.

					But before we can say goodbye, we still have another task for you. Santa Catarina's west region has fallen into complete darkness, for a tornado devastated the region. Before, the electrical infrastructure was amazing, so that two energy towers were connected directly by energy cables if and only if between those towers there was a road. The tornado did not damage the roads, only the towers and energy cables. Among all companies which proposed to restore the electrical infrastructure of the region, the one which has presented the best proposal was Pikachu S. A. In order to start the jobs, Pikachu S. A. has asked the Government for some information. If this information does not satisfy some conditions, Pikachu S. A. will annul the contract and the Government will have to hire another company, for our sadness. By the way, the conditions required by Pikachu S. A. are:


	The company will not build any new tower, only will restore all the old towers.
	The company will not connect two towers by energy cables if those towers were not connected before.
	The company will make only the minimum number of connections between towers needed to interconnect all towers, directly or indirectly, and will spend as least as possible of metres of cabling.
	Each tower restored will need to receive a Pikachu S. A.'s employee to monitor the tower daily. This employee can be either a permanent employee or a trainee.
	If the employees that two towers receive are trainees, then there must be a road connecting both towers directly.
	If the employees that two towers receive are permanent employees, then there cannot be a road connecting both towers directly.
	The number of permanent employees must be minimal.


A curiosity about the old infrastructure is that to each tower a binary code has been assigned, so that the connection between two towers, if there was any, would cost, in centimetres of cabling, exactly the length of the greatest binary subcode common to the codes of both towers. For example, if the codes of two towers were respectively 000011 e 001100, the cost of the connection between these two towers was, and still is, 4.";The first input line contains two integers, N and M (2 ≤ N ≤ 103, 0 ≤ M ≤ 105), which respectively represent the number of towers and the number of connections in the old infrastructure, such that each connection is described in one of the M lines following by two integers, i and j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N), which identify the towers that were connected.

1990;Equilibrium;Mathematics;9;"The mean and the median usually confuse the students because of their similar spelling, but they are quite different concepts. In this problem we are going to work with the mean and the median of a set consisting of N pairwise distinct integers, where N is odd. The mean of such set is defined, as usual, as the sum of the numbers divided by N, while the median is the unique element in the set that is greater than (N-1)/2 of its elements, and less than the other (N-1)/2 elements in the set. For instance, if the set is {0, 2, 6, 4, 13}, then the mean is 5 while the median is 4.

                    We aim to make student's lives easier by generating ""balanced"" sets, that is, sets consisting of an odd number of pairwise distinct integers where the mean and the median coincide. For example, the set {0, 2, 6, 4, -2} is balanced, since it has N=5 different integers, and the mean and the median are both equal to 2.

                    The following procedure has been suggested in order to obtain balanced sets. A set with an even number of distinct integers is chosen, and an extra integer distinct from every element in the set is added to it, in such a way that the resulting set is balanced. We want you to check if the given procedure works. Therefore your task is, given N-1 distinct integers, with odd N, count the number of balanced sets that can be formed by following the described procedure.";The input contains several test cases.

1991;Factory of Bridges;Computational Geometry;10;"In the Central Area of Macedonia there is a river following the East-West direction. The region's inhabitants want to build a bridge that crosses the river in the North-South direction, a task for which they have contracted the cheapest bridge factory they know, the Short Bridge Construction Company. As shown by its name, this construction company specializes in building the shortest possible bridges for each river.

                    The first thing that the company does is to model the river's shores (Northern and Southern). Each of these is considered as being formed by semicircles of varying radii, alternatively oriented to one side or the other, with all their centers collinear. The two lines that are defined by the centers of the semicircles of each shore have the East-West direction, and are separated by a distance A one from the other. The value A is called the width of the river. Note that both shores are aligned, that is, the Northern shore neither begins nor ends further to the West or to the East than the Southern shore.

                    In the following figure you can see the model of a certain river. In the Northern shore the semicircle furthest to the West is oriented to the North, whereas in the Southern shore the semicircle furthest to the West is oriented to the South. In each shore the orientations of the following semicircles alternate. The shortest possible bridge in the North-South direction is the one shown.

Each test case is described by three lines. The first line contains an integer number A, denoting the width of the river in meters (3 <= A <= 104). The second line describes the Northern shore of the river, while the third line describes its Southern shore.

                    The description of each shore begins with an integer number C giving the number of semicircles that are used to model that shore (1 <= C <= 1000). This is followed by a character ""N"" or ""S"", meaning that the semicircle furthest to the West in this shore is oriented to the North or to the South, respectively. The description ends with C integer numbers R_i, representing the radii in meters of the semicircles that form the shore (1 <= R_i < A/2 for 1 <= i <= C). The semicircles are given in order, from the one furthest to the West (radius R_1) to the one furthest to the East (radius R_C). The orientations of the semicircles alternate between North and South after the first semicircle, whose orientation is given as described above. Assume that in each test case both shores are aligned, which implies that the sum of the radii of the semicircles forming each shore is the same.

1992;Gaining Time;Mathematics;2;"Gabriela drives a school bus. Being one of the few women who have that job, she is always mocked by the male drivers. To improve her status, she decided that besides driving responsibly she is going to drive more efficiently. Her idea is to finish her route spending as little time as possible, without violating any traffic rule.

                    The bus Gabriela drives has a very modern driving system that allows her to adjust the acceleration to any real number instantly. Hence, the acceleration is constant by intervals, jumping to another acceleration whenever Gabriela decides so. If v is the bus' speed at a given instant of time, and a its acceleration that remains constant over a period of time t, then the speed at the end of that period will be v + at. Moreover, the bus will move a distance of at2/2 + vt during that period of time.

                    The traffic rules prevent vehicles from using an acceleration greater than A, or a deceleration less than D, i.e. the acceleration a at any time must satisfy -D <= a <= A. Moreover, there are check points along the route of the bus where the speed must lie within a certain given interval.

                    Gabriela knows in advance the location of the check points, the total length of the route, and the constants A and D. At the beginning of the route the speed and acceleration of the bus are both 0.

Your job is to use this data to determine the minimum time that Gabriela needs in order to finish the route without violating the rules.";The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described using several lines. The first line of each test case contains four integers N, L, A and D. N represents the total number of check points that are present in Gabriela's route (1 <= N <= 105). L indicates the length of the route in meters (2 <= L <= 107). A and D represent, respectively, the maximum allowed acceleration and deceleration for the bus (1 <= A, D <= 100). Each of the following N lines describe a different check point using three integers X, V and W that represent, respectively, the distance between the check point and the starting point of the route (1 <= X<= L-1), the minimum speed, and the maximum speed allowed for the bus at the time it passes by that check point (1 <= V, W <= 100). Assume that in each test case the check points are given in ascending order of distance from the start point of the route, and no two check points are at the same distance from the start point. In this problem, the length is expressed in m (meters), the speed in m/s, and the acceleration in m/s2.

1993;He is Lazy;Graph;8;"As we all know, Humberto is really lazy. He is so lazy that he sticks his nose out of the window so that the wind will blow it for him. Obviously, he hasn't worked at all in his whole life. However, he got lucky and won a lot of money in the lottery. With some of that money he bought an empty field, and made build several houses inside of it, where he moved with his family and friends. Thus, Humberto can go in a straight line from any point in his field to any other, without having to make detours because of urban design (for the sake of simplicity, we consider the objects in Humberto's field as dots, so they don't interfere in Humberto's way).

                    Sadly, that was not enough for Humberto, so in order to walk even less he decided to have installed some catapults in strategic points of his field. Each catapult can send him from the point where it is installed, to any point at a certain fixed distance (that depends on the range of the catapult).

                    But, in spite of simplifying his life, the catapults made the task of choosing a way in the field a real headache, because Humberto wants to walk as less as possible.

Each of the next N lines describes a different catapult, using three integers C_X, C_Y and F, that indicate the point (C_X, C_Y) where the catapult of strength F is installed.

1994;Imperialism;Graph;8;"The ambition of conquest and expansion is a very well known disease in planet Earth... and also in the entire universe.

                    In planet “Imperius” several fortresses have been built one at a time and each one of them but the first was connected at the moment of its construction to a previously built fortress by a direct path, for commercial purposes.

                    Imperius was becoming one of the most peaceful and prosperous planet in the universe, until they built no more fortresses. At that moment, N different empires emerged (numbered from 1 to N), each one of them dominating a different fortress. And the thirst of conquest took Imperius. Thus, every year, exactly one of the living empires conquers every neighbor empire, and dominates every fortress belonging to them. Two empires are considered neighbors if there exist two fortresses joined by a path, each one dominated by one different empire of these two.

1996;A Canvas Building;Paradigms;9;"The International Canvas Preparation Committee (ICPC) has a peculiar procedure for setting up its canvases. The procedure depends on a bidimensional view of the canvases.

                    A given canvas is set up using N poles of different heights. To set up the canvases, the ICPC uses the following procedure. First, N+2 points are marked on the floor, all on the same line, so that two consecutive points are always separated by a distance of exactly two feet. Afterwards, a pole is placed vertically over each of the N central points. Finally, the canvas is extended over the poles, joining the upper end of each pole with the upper end of neighboring poles. The first and last poles are joined with the free points on the floor.

                    The next figure shows 3 possible ways of setting up a canvas using the instructions mentioned before, with pole heights of 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9.

                     
                        

                    After years of hard work, the ICPC came to the conclusion that in order to obtain useful and sturdy canvases, it is necessary that the angle formed by two consecutive patches of canvas at the end of a pole, measured towards the inside, is strictly less than 180 degrees. In the figure shown, only the canvas on the left satisfies this condition. The canvas in the middle has an angle greater than 180 degrees at poles of heights 4 and 7, while the canvas on the right has an angle of exactly 180 degrees at the pole of height 8. We say a canvas is valid when it adheres to the ICPC recommendation.

                    Of course, given the number of poles and their heights, there are a lot of different ways of placing them, some of which will produce valid canvases and some of which will not. The task at hand is to, given this data, count the number of different valid canvases which can be set up.

A particular variant of Awari is played with N boxes numbered from 1 to N, each containing at the beginning of the game zero or more stones. The rules of this game are very simple, because there is only one type of valid move, consisting of choosing a box numbered i containing exactly i stones, and then taking those stones from the box in order to use them to add a single stone to every box numbered 1 through i-1; the remaining stone is then kept by the player. These moves are applied in succession as long as there exists a box i containing exactly i stones. When this is no longer true, the game ends.

However, guests coming from the same kingdom are not allowed to dance with one another.

                    To help organize the ball, the total number of dances that will take place is determined beforehand, so that care must be taken when choosing the number of noblemen that shall be invited from each kingdom. For example, if it is decided that the ball must have N = 20 dances, one possibility is to invite 6 noblemen from Cubiconia, 2 from Quadradonia and 1 from Nlogonia, which can be represented by the expression(6, 2, 1). This is a valid option because the total number of dances would then be 6*2 +6*1+ 2*1 = 20.

                    Traditions whose origins nobody can now remember indicate that the number of invited noblemen from Cubiconia must be greater or equal to the number of those coming from Quadradonia, and at the same time the number of invited noblemen from Quadradonia must be greater or equal to those coming from Nlogonia.

2007;Fence the Vegetables Fail;Mathematics;9;"At the early age of 40, Alice and Bob decided to retire. After more than two decades working as examples for networking protocols, game theoretical books and several other texts, they were tired. To remain active, they decided to get into gardening.

Alice and Bob planted several vegetable plants in a huge field. After finishing, they realized that their plants needed protection from wild animals, so they decided to build a fence around them. The field is represented as the XY plane, and each vegetable plant as a different point in it. A fence is represented as a polygon in the plane. However, not every polygon is a valid fence. The fence needs to be a single simple polygon with each of its sides parallel to one of the axes. Of course, the polygon should contain all the points representing vegetable plants. A fence too close to the plants or to itself could make it difficult to walk around, so each side of the polygon needs to be away from all plants and all non-adjacent sides.

Unfortunately, Alice and Bob subcontracted the construction of the fence to a nasty multinational. The company had a lot of lawyers on payroll, but no good fence designers, so they failed to comply to all requirements. They built a fence which is a simple polygon with sides parallel to the axes and whose sides are away from plants and itself. However, they forgot to make the fence contain all the plants!

Lately Jurgen has been studying sorted lists, but he is getting bored. He thinks that such lists are too predictable and not very abundant, so he decided to spice things up a bit.

Jurgen says that a list l of N not necessarily different positive integers is just a bit sorted if and only if for each positive integer x > 1 that occurs in l, the number x − 1 appears at least once before the last occurrence of x in l. For example

• [ 2, 3, 1, 2 ] is just a bit sorted because a 1 appears before the last 2, and a 2 appears before the last 3;

2010;Keep it Energized;Ad-Hoc;7;"The Incredible Consoles Production Company (ICPC) is now designing its newest video game console model, the Super-Arcade Reloaded (SAR). The launch of the SAR will be accompanied by the release of a flagship game, which will only be available to its users. This game, which incidentally shall be called Adventures of Captain Mikado (ACM), even features an in-game currency which can be conveniently bought using real-world money!

The ACM is a very simple game consisting of N levels numbered 1, 2, . . . , N, the i-th level requiring exactly Ei units of energy to be completed. This means that in order to complete that level, the user’s energy should be at least Ei , and after doing so it will decrease in exactly that amount. To win the game the user should complete all the levels in increasing order, starting at level 1 and continuing until level N without ever going back to some already-completed level.

Initially the user starts with no energy, and in order to get some he must buy energy packs from the ingame shops distributed among the N levels. There are M such shops. Each shop sells an energy pack having a strength S and a cost C that depend on the shop. The user can only buy energy packs from the shops in the level he is currently in, before starting to complete that level. The effect of buying an energy pack of strength S is that the user’s energy immediately turns into S, regardless of which value it had before.

In order to increase even further its sales, the ICPC has thought of a revolutionary promotion: it will reimburse the full cost of the SAR to whoever completes the ACM game using the minimum amount of in-game cash.

When the elves realized Santa’s absence they decided to take time off from work to play a game they’ve been planning for some time.

The game the elves invented involves N gifts that they had recently made, which are in format of cubes with dimensions AxBxC, or in other words, A centimeters of width, B centimeters of height and C centimeters of depth.

The goal is simple: given the N gifts, win the game the one who can pile all the N gifts one at the top of the other building a stack of maximum height. The gifts must be piled in order, or in other words, first the gift 1 is put on the ground, then the gift 2 is piled on the top of the gift 1, and so on.

It is worth noting that it is possible to rotate the gift on any axis in a way that any of its 6 faces gets parallel to the ground, however the perimeter of such face must be completely restrained inside the perimeter of the superior face of the gift below it. In the case of the first gift it is possible to choose any face, because the ground is big enough.

For example, be N = 2, where the first gift has dimensions 5x2x2, and the second gift has dimensions 1x3x4, it is possible to position the first gift with the face of dimensions 2x2 facing down and reach a height equal to 5, however this solution makes it impossible to pile the second gift on top of the first. A possible solution would be to position the first gift with the face of dimensions 5x2 facing down, and pile the second gift with the face of dimensions 3x1 on top of the first, reaching a valid solution with height equals to 6, as can be seen on Figure 1.

                    The set he defined is called the Cantor set, and it is formed by all the real numbers in the interval [0, 1]whose decimal expression in base 3 uses exclusively the digits 0 and 2.

Each team is formed by N players, but because the two world cups do not take place simultaneously it was agreed that the ICPC would provide only N t-shirts, to be used by both teams.

                    For this reason, the t-shirts must be a valid set of clothing for both teams. The rules of the rugby world cups state that each player must go in the field with a t-shirt imprinted with a unique number, along with a prefix of the player's surname, not necessarily unique. This includes boundary cases such as a t-shirt with no surname prefix (that is, a prefix of length 0) and a t-shirt with a complete surname.

                    The experts of ICPC immediately realized that they could simply provide N t-shirts with only numbers and no surnames on them, and each of them would be a valid t-shirt to be used by any player of any of the two teams.

2036;Domino Effect;Paradigms;10;"The domino effect is a phenomenon that occurs when in a line of domino pieces, each standing on its smallest face, the first piece from one of the line's ends falls in the direction of the next piece. In turn, this second piece falls over the third one in the line, and so on until the other end of the line is reached, at which point every piece has fallen. Note that in order to produce this effect, the distance between consecutive pieces in the line must be lower or equal to their height.

Each competitor can face any other competitor any number of times, and it is even possible that some competitors never play against others.

2038;Generating Alien DNA;Graph;10;"GigaFarma is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, and it is currently conducting experiments using alien DNA. Its goal is to produce a chain of alien DNA that will report the maximum possible benefit when commercialized.

                    A chain of alien DNA can be understood as a non-empty sequence of genes connected by links, and in turn each gene is a non-empty sequence of bases. Because not every possible sequence of bases corresponds to a valid gene, GigaFarma has created a catalogue of genes that appear in alien DNA, which are the only ones considered valid sequences of bases. Each of these genes has a value according to its functionality, and a given chain of alien DNA has a market value that is the sum of the values of the genes that compose it.

                    We will represent the different bases with lowercase letters, 'a'-'z', and links using a hyphen '-'. In the following example we can see on the left a possible list of genes and their corresponding values; on the right there are some chains of alien DNA that can be formed with these genes, along with their corresponding market values.

                    

                    GigaFarma can only produce very specific DNA chains, which we call producible. These chains are a non-empty sequence of DNA portions that the company can synthesize, joined without any additional links between them. Each portion is a sequence of bases and links containing at least one link, but without any consecutive, initial or final links. Each portion has a given cost, determined by the difficulty associated to its production, so each producible chain of DNA has a production cost that is the sum of the costs of each of the portions that form it. In the following example, we can see on the left a list of DNA portions and their costs; on the right we have some producible chains of DNA that can be formed with these portions, along with their associated production cost.

                    

                    Note that there might be multiple ways of forming the same producible chain using different portions. This is the case of ""como-como-les"" in the example, which can be obtained using portions ""como-co"" and ""mo-les"" with a production cost of 7, or just using ""como-como-les"" with a production cost of 12. Of course, when there is more than one way to synthesize a given producible chain of DNA, GigaFarma will always do so using the cheapest possible process.

                    Clearly, the set of alien DNA chains is infinite, just like the set of producible DNA chains. However, GigaFarma is not directly interested in any of these sets, but in their intersection. If we check the previous examples, we can see that ""como-les"" is a valid alien DNA chain, but is not producible, ""mo-les"" is producible, but is not an alien DNA chain and ""como-como-les"" is both.

                    For each alien and producible DNA chain, the company can commercialize this chain to get a net benefit that equals the market value of this chain minus its production cost. Of course, if this net benefit is not positive, the corresponding chain will never be produced. Because there is so much genetic material all over the place, GigaFarma would pay anything in order to know what is the maximum net benefit it can obtain for some producible and alien DNA chain.";"Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains two integer numbers G and P, representing the number of genes in the catalogue and the number of portions GigaFarma can produce (1 ≤ G, P ≤ 100).

The string S has between 1 and 10 characters, and is formed solely by lowercase letters representing the bases that form this gene; the integer V represents the value of this gene (1 ≤ V ≤ 1000).

                    Each of the following P lines describe a different DNA portion, using a string T and an integer C. The stringT has between 1 and 30 characters, and is composed of lowercase letters and hyphens only, respectively representing the bases and links in this portion.

2039;Programmers Should Learn Theory of Computation;Graph;6;"During his adventure in Imaginationland, Alan Leopold ""Butters"" Stotch Turing invented his famous ice cream machine. You only have to say the flavor and the machine makes a delicious ice cream!

					At this moment, Butters is worried about one thing. He is capable of building his machine in many different ways; and he's doing experiments to decide which is the best. You decided to help him, because you're anxious for a vanilla ice cream. Given a description of a machine and a series of Q queries of flavors, Butters wants to know how many steps this machine takes to make the ice cream of each query.

					An ice cream machine is a configuration with a state (an integer number), a string and a position in this string. For each configuration <state,string,position>, a step is generating a new configuration: the state is updated, the symbol at the current position is updated; and the current position is moved to an adjacent one (leftward, or rightward). If the command moves the position to a position beyond the limits of the string, a white space should be concatenated in the respective end of the string; and the position of the new configuration should point to this white space. The machine starts with the configuration <1,flavor,1>, where flavor is a string and the second 1 indicates the first position of this string. The machine halts when it reaches a configuration whose state is the integer S, as in ""sorvete"" (ice cream in portuguese).

					The magical trick is that, for each configuration <state,string,position>, the Butters machine is capable of executing many different steps, so it can make the ice cream faster. Whenever the machine reaches a configuration that leads to multiple new configurations, the machine creates copies of itself, so each copy continues independently. There is a new copy for each new configuration. After creating copies for new configurations, the machine dies. If a particular configuration doesn't leads to any new configuration, it just dies. The process ends when any copy halts and finishes making the ice cream. It is guaranteed that some branch of the machine will halt and give the ice cream.";"The input has several test cases and finishes with end of file.

2047;Fly By Night;Data Structures and Libraries;8;"Bill Poucher announced in Shanghai (China), on last April, that the thirtieth ACM-ICPC World Final will be held in San Antonio (USA) on the second week of 2006.

                    Upon becoming aware of such information (a few months late), an air transport company on Texas - known as Fly by Night Ltd. - decided to take advantage of the event to increment its annual revenue.

                    The goal of the company's CEO was to offer air transport to the teams (including contestants and coaches) and to the support staff (those who make things work) from their cities of origin, in their countries of origin, to the contest site. Trying to ensure the success of his idea, the same CEO offered prices slightly below the market price for those who would be transported. As they were mostly students and professors, they accepted in a minute.

                    As you probably guessed, Fly by Night Ltd. operates night flights. However, instead of having its own airplanes, the company just sells seats in other companies' flights. The company gets a good comission due to the fact that those flights have, historically, a low occupation.

                    However, when the company's employees were checking the flights that were available for the operation, they had a big surprise. Most flights where completely full. Those who were not full didn't have many free seats. Nobody could explain the reason for the irregular demand. Two hypotheses were raised: the proximity of the american spring-break and the popularity of the contest. :-)

                    Trying to save the company (and his own position), the CEO realized it would be necessary to perform indirect flights and transfers. This way, the profit woud be lower, but nothing compared to the loss that the company would have by operating daytime flights or failing to transport the passengers (who, at the time, had already paid for their tickets).

                    The Fly by Night Ltd. employees proposed a set of scenarios with the flights that could be used. What was noticed shortly thereafter was that not all scenarios were viable, since they could not transport the necessary amount of passengers. Finally, the CEO noticed that he didn't have qualified staff to deal with the situation. You were hired to develop a program that, for each built scenario, answer if the scenario is viable or not.";"A scenario, from now on, will be called instance. Your program must be prepared to deal with various instances.

                    Each instance starts with an integer 0 ≤ m ≤ 100 that specifies the number of origin cities of the passengers to be transported. A value m = 0 indicates the end of the instances and must not be processed. Otherwise, for each of the next m lines, the name of a city and the respective number of passengers from that city are given (an non-negative integer less than or equals to 100). The name of the city is between 1 and 20 caracters from the alphabet Σ={a,b,...,z,-}

                    In the next line are given an integer 0 ≤ n ≤ 100, that represents the number of flights in the instance, and the name of the city where the event will occur (the CEO decided that the program must accept that). The name of that city follow the same rules above.

                    In each of the n next lines are given the names of two cities of a flight (origin and destination, respectivelly), followed by a non-negative integer less than of equals to 200 that represents the number of free seats in that flight. Again, the names of the cities are from Σ and with length between 1 and 20. You can assume that there aren't two cities with the same name and that the cities of origin and destination are always different. Furthermore, Fly by Night Ltd. doesn't work with more than one flight between any two cities.

                    In each line of the input, any number of spaces may separate the provided data.";For each solved instance, you must print an identifier Instancia h, where h is an integer number, sequential and increasing from 1.

2048;Houston, We've Got a Problem!;Graph;7;"On July 1st, 1947, a strange object was detected by american force radars installed on Roswell, White Sands and Alamogordo. The tremendous speed and the erratic moves of the object indicated that it wasn't an airplane or meteorite. Four days later, a shepherd and a group of archaeologists found remains of a crashed object to the north of Roswell. Thereafter, american authorities step in and transport the remains of the object to Fort Worth, Texas. They said the wreckage were simply remains of an experimental weather balloon. Many people, however, think it was the remains of an unidentified flying object (UFO). Many years have passed since then, and the case continues to attract attention and generate controversy.

                    A group of ufologists rooted on San Antonio, a texan city located south-southwest of Fort Worth, is convinced that extraterrestrial beings have visited the region frequently ever since. After a lot of research, the ufologists found that they could build an alternative communication network to try to contact the ETs. Such a network would use remains of the old telegraph system from the Texas desert and its alternativity comes from the attempt to avoid, according to them, the intromission of the aforementioned authorities.

                    After a thorough survey (that identified posts, wirings, capacitors, transformers, etc.), the ufologists realized that information transmitted through certain parts of the old telegraph structure had worse quality than others. Based on statistical samples, they obtained, for some pairs of points u and v of the old network, a probability puv of having interference on information transmitted between u and v. Knowing that you would be in the region in April next year, they asked you to build a program to identify the smaller set of paths to be used so that (i) all the desired points are interconnected (even indirectly), and (ii) the total probability of interference on the messages sent through this network is minimum.

On the m following lines, are given (in each line) two integers 1 ≤ u,v ≤ n and a rational 0 ≤ puv ≤ 1 representing that between two points u and v, the probability of interference is puv.

Surprisingly the Indians already knew the Hindu numerals, but they did not use it for calculations (after all trade in that civilization did not exist). Baylor archaeologists suspect that the panels full of numbers were merely decorative. Also suspect that some patterns that recurred were signatures of the artists in order to ensure the authenticity of the panel.

2053;ET Phone Home;Paradigms;6;"Since early 2006 the Seti@home (search program of alien’s life) has recorded strange patterns in radio transmissions received from space. Initially it was believed to treat only about static. But with time and repetition transmissions researchers were becoming convinced that there was something more. Invited to join the project, linguists at Baylor University have identified a language in the transmission. It was a very simple language.

                    The language has several rules of word composition. The composition rules will be described in this problem by the following elements: a set of non-terminal symbols V; a set of terminal symbols T; a special non-terminal symbol called the root; a set of rules for the composition of words.

                    All rules of composition that will be considered here will be the form A → BC or of the form A → a, where A, B, C are elements of V and a is an element of T. The notation above indicates that we can replace the non-terminal A to the left of the arrow by the terminal a (the first case) or by the concatenation of non-terminals A and B (the second case) that appear to the right of the arrow.

                    Repeatedly applying the rules of composition on the root symbol, we can assemble valid words in the language.

                    For example, suppose the following set of composition rules is valid:

                    S → AB

                    A → a

                    B → b

                    The word ab can be obtained from this set of rules of composition as follows:

                    S → AB

                    AB → aB, because A → a

                    aB → ab, because B → b

                    However, the word b can’t be produced from S from that same set of composition rules.

In this city a game became famous, ""Streichholzpiramidentfernungspiel"" as known and appreciated by the spies from both sides of Germany.

                    The game starts with 6 rows of matches. The first row contains 1 match, the second contains 3, the third 5, the fourth 7, the fifth 9 and the sisth 11. Below is a design scheme of the original game.

                    

                    Two people participate in this game, alternating movements. In each turn, a person must take a quantity of matches different than zero from the board. All matches taken in a turn must belong to the same row. Therefore, if a row contains k matches and a player decides to take matches from this row in his turn, he has k different move options (he can take between 1 and k matches).

                    If after a turn the board becomes completely empty (i.e., no matches in every one of the 6 rows), the player from the last turn (the player who removed the last matches) loses the game.

2055;Lisp is Better than Java, C and C++;Strings;9;"However, differently of traditional benchmarks, Prechelt compared different implementations of the same task made by 38 different developers (in experience and knowledge). Prechelt's study showed that Java is from 3 to 4 times slower than C or C++, but the greater variations ocurred between the programmers, not between the languages, suggesting that it's better to spend more time training the developers instead of discussing which language should be picked.

                    Years later Garret extended this study adding Lisp as one of the possible implementations to the problem, and this time, besides considering the comparing factors used by Prechelt, he added the development time as metric. Garret's results were surprising: Lisp was the best in all aspects, requiring less time and code lines, using less memory and executing faster than the programs in C, C++ or Java. It was proven that Lisp programmers are much better than other programmers. This is your chance to prove that Garret's study was wrong. How? Solving the same problem, in less time and with faster implementations.

The dictionary words may have upper and lower case letters, hifen (-) and quotation marks (""), but you must use only the letters to encode a number. The word must be printed as given in the dictionary. The encoding of a phone number may consist of one or more words, separated by a single space. The encoding is made word by word, from left to right. If at some point of the encoding no word from the dictionary can be inserted, then a single digit of the number can be used in the encoding, but two consecutive numbers aren't allowed in a valid encoding. In other words: in a parcial encoding that covers k digits, the digit k+1 is encoded by itself if and only if, first, the digit k wasn't encoded by a digit and, second, there isn't any word in the dictionary that can be used in the encoding starting from digit k+1.";Each instance is composed by a line with an integer 0 < n ≤ 75000, the number of words in the dictionary.

A box cannot be moved in any other way (you cannot pull it, for instance). Therefore, if the box reaches an edge of the labyrinth, you will not be able to move it again.

2059;Odd, Even or Cheating;Beginner;2;"A new game called Odd, Even or Cheating is currently (OEC) is now one of the most popular games in the world. This game was created when some friends had no internet connection, no cellphone, no computer, and pretty much nothing to do. The game is so popular that is going to happen the mundial championship of OEC and each country of the world will choose a representant to compete in this championship.

The game works like this: it's a two players game, the player 1 chooses between odd or even, then each player chooses a positive integer, if the sum of these number is even and player 1 chose even, then player 1 wins, if the sum is odd and player 2 chose odd, then player 2 wins. If player 1 chooses odd he/she wins when the sum is odd, and player 2 wins when the sum is even. Nothing new, right?

But now there are two more possible moves, player 1 can cheat to make sure that he/she wins independently of the result of the conventional odd or even game, and player 2 can accuse player 1 of cheating. With these additions in the game if player 1 cheats and player 2 accuses him/her of cheating player 2 wins, if player 2 don't accuse and player 1 is cheating then player 1 wins, if player 2 accuses the cheat, but player 1 is not cheating then player 1 wins, if player 1 isn't cheating and player 2 doesn't accuse player 1 then the game will be played as described previously.

On December 22, 1895, Röntgen did an x-ray of the hand of his wife (with a ring on one of her fingers). The discovery of X-rays caused a stir at the time and already in 1896 European papers reported the invention and the great possibilities of looking inside the body without having to cut it. Röntgen's death, caused by a certain type of cancer is attributed to the constant radiation to which he was exposed during his scientific researches.

                    Röntgen began to suspect the existence of invisible radiation when, in his research, he was able to measure significant changes in the fluorescence of objects when placed in a Lenard tube who was subjected to an electric current. Röntgen's studies were so accurate that it could even generate the sequence that was observed in the Lenard tube at each instant of time. The observed fluorescence depended on the intensity of the electric current (X) and the time at which the tube was subjected to electric current (Y). Röntgen realized that given the first sequence, the next could be obtained describing the numbers of the previous sequence. For example, if the first sequence is 2 then the next is 12 (ie, the previous sequence is formed by "" a 2""), the following 1112 (ie, the previous sequence is formed by an 1 and a 2), 3112 (ie, the previous sequence is formed by three 1 and a 2), and so on.

Let's imagine that Mary, Peter and Amanda began to play and have already decided who will say what product, Maria will tell Bread, Peter likes cheese and Amanda will talk Apple.
Assuming that the queue is organized in alphabetical order the game should go as follows:

                    In this way, if i < j the distance in clockwise order from house i to house j is j-i, whereas the corresponding distance in counterclockwise order is N - j + i. Note that the distance from a house to itself is N in both directions. It is well known that the people of Nlogonia are avid football fans, so when a family moves to a house on the side of the lake it is very important for them to know who are their closest neighbors that follow the same team as they do. This is not always easy, since there may be many houses around the lake, many different football teams in Nlogonia, and a lot of moving around. Given a sequence of M movings, people who live on the shore of the lake want to welcome each new family arriving by telling them the distance from their new home to the closest houses that follow the same team as they do, both in clockwise and counterclockwise order.

2093;Escaping from Escaping;Strings;9;"A communications protocol is a set of rules designed to transfer information in a communications system. Elisa's job is to write programs that implement parts of said protocols. It is often necessary for this to transfer sequences of fields, and in order to know where a field ends and the next one begins it is customary to insert a separator between each pair of consecutive fields. Using a simple separator such as a space, a comma or a semicolon is inconvenient because sometimes the fields to be transferred contain these same characters. The standard solution in these cases is to insert an ""escaping"" character just before every appearance of a separator inside a field, so that it can be thus distinguished from a real separator. Elisa thinks this solution will increase a lot the length of the data to be transmitted, so she has decided to use a separator that is complex enough for it to never appear inside the data. In this way she hopes to escape the inefficient alternative of escaping separators.

                    To choose the ideal separator, Elisa has compiled a log, which is nothing else than a long string of characters that is representative of the data that her protocol needs to manage. After thinking about the problem for a while, Elisa reached the conclusion that any non-empty string of characters that does not appear inside the log would be an acceptable separator for use within her protocol. But because she is interested in minimizing the length of the data to be transmitted, she would like to know the minimal length that an acceptable separator can have. 

                    She immediately wrote a program to calculate this length, and is now testing it for the particular case in which both the log and the acceptable separators only contain binary digits ('0' and '1').

2096;Horace and His Primes;Mathematics;7;"Horace likes to play writing natural numbers in the blackboard in his bedroom. One of his favourite games consists in first writing a number n, then the sum of all the different prime numbers that divide n, and so on until the number written on the board becomes a prime number. For example, if Horace begins writing the number n = 90, because 90 = 2 × 32 × 5 the next number to be written will be 2 + 3 + 5 = 10; then, as 10 = 2 × 5 Horace will write the number 2 + 5 = 7; finally, because 7 is a prime number the game will end here.
                    Formally, in this game each natural number n >= 2 defines a sequence whose first element is n, and each new element is the sum of all the prime numbers that divide the previous element in the sequence. The order of the game is the position of the first prime number in the sequence, and coincides with the total number of numbers written on the blackboard one the game has ended. In the example from the previous paragraph, with n = 90 the order of the game is K = 3, because the numbers that are written will be 90, 10 and 7.

2098;Treasure Island;Graph;5;"Finding the treasures hidden centuries ago by the pirates of the Caribbean islands is no easy task, but even more difficult is living to tell the story. This is because, as everybody knows, pirates had supernatural powers which they used to curse the person who took their treasure unauthorized.

                    A very common curse among the most powerful of pirates, and for which it is always a good idea to be prepared, is known today as the deadly mist. Whenever a pirate's treasure is found, this curse will make a poisonous mist lift from the ground until the whole island gets covered by it. Any living creature that is touched by the mist will die instantly, something especially undesirable for those who have just found a treasure. The only way to save yourself is then to return to your boat, always going through areas that have not yet been covered by the mist, and thus flee with that part of the treasure that may have been rescued. In this problem we are interested in knowing what's the maximum amount of time that one can take to collect the treasure in such a way so as to be able to return to the boat alive.

                    To simplify the problem, we will consider that an island can be represented by a grid with R rows and Ccolumns, in which the cell in the i-th row and the j-th column has height Hij above sea level. Furthermore, we will assume that the treasure is always hidden in the cell in row 1 and column 1, because this is the one furthest away from the only place where the boat can set anchor, which is the cell in row R and column C. The deadly mist appears at sea level at the very same instant that the treasure is found, and then rises on all the island at a rate of one unit of height per second, so that after t seconds one cannot be in any cell of height less or equal to t. In order to return to the boat, you may go from one cell to another only if they share a side, so that if you are on a given cell you can only move horizontally to the cell before or after it in the same row, or vertically to the cell before or after it in the same column, but you cannot move diagonally or cross the boundaries of the island.

2099;Game of Stones;Paradigms;5;"Jaimito loves to play with the N identical stones that he was given for his birthday, piling them to form mountains of various sizes. His happiness would be perfect if her mother, Jimena, did not constantly remind him that at the end of the day comes the Time to Arrange the Piles (TAP). It is then that Jaimito must destroy his mountains of stones, which he had piled up with so much effort. Because Jimena knows how much Jaimito is bothered by the TAP, she suggests to play a game with him in order to make this task more fun. Jaimito and his mother take turns to play, with Jaimito starting because he is the youngest. 
                    Initially there are one or more mountains, each one of them composed of a certain number of stones. In his turn each player chooses a mountain with more than one stone and divides it to form two mountains, not necessarily of the same size. The game continues in this way until one of the players cannot make a valid move, at which point this player is declared the looser, the other player being the winner. 
                    Jaimito is a very smart kid, and he has realized that he can distribute the N stones to form the mountains in a strategic way, so as to be certain that when they begin to play with these mountains he will undoubtedly win during the TAP. Because of the way the game works, Jaimito will not consider that two initial arrangements of the stones are different if they only change in the order in which the mountains are given. This means that in order for him to consider two initial distributions to be different, these need to have a different number of mountains or, if the number of mountains is the same, then the stones must be distributed in a different way among the mountains. For example, if Jaimito has N = 4 stones, there are five ways in which he can initially distribute them in mountains: four mountains of one stone each; two mountains of one stone each, and another mountain with two stones; one mountain of one stone, and another mountain with three stones; two mountains of two stones each; and, lastly, a single mountain with all four stones. Because Jaimito does not want his mother to realize that he is cheating, he wants to change the initial distribution of the N stones every day. He is convinced that there are many different ways to initially arrange the stones that will guarantee him the victory, but he does not know how many exactly. For example, in the case with N = 4 stones Jaimito only has two possible ways to choose from: a single mountain with four stones, or two mountains of one stone each and another mountain with two stones. Your team's task in this problem is to help Jaimito count the number of different ways in which he can distribute his N stones in mountains in such a way that his victory is certain when playing against Jimena.

Once the bacteria were very poorly made, with a lot of last minute kludges, the only thing he achieved was a terrible stench in the environment.

                    Before the beginning of the journey, some decisions had to be taken with respect to the way of life that these people would take on the other planet. One of those decisions was that the duration of a day would be the same in all planets inhabited by humans, that is, the word ""day"" becomes simply a term that means ""24 hours"" and no more a term that specifies a complete rotation of the planet around itself. However, it was decided that the duration of the month may vary from planet to planet.

                    An alien civilization intends to invade our planet, but first they need to get trough the barrier of floating platforms. To do so, they are going to use a laser super multi-cannon, that shoots, at the same time, thousands of laser beams, from a single point. This way they are able to aim in all platforms of our planet and destroy all of them at the same time, without giving us any time of reaction.

                    The biggest problem is that the laser beams are so powerful that they don't stop after destroying the floating platforms, they end up hitting earth after that. When the ray hits the solo, each laser beam turns into an energy sphere, and each energy sphere attach to another energy sphere through wires, also energized, forming a power grid that cannot be touched. It is a highly dangerous and destructive attack.

                    Each player has two card of their own and there are five cards common to both players on the table. The player with the best hand of five cards among his own two and the five on the table wins. A card from the table can be used by both players at the same time and the player hand can be obtained by ignoring the two cards of their own and using the five cards common to both of them.

                    In order to compare two hands, you have to check which hands they match on the list below. If a hand matches more than one type, you must choose the most valuable one. If two hands match a same type, you apply the tiebreaker rule specific to this type.

                    The list of hands, sorted from the least valuable to the most valuable, and their respective tiebreaker criteria is:

                    
                        High card: any hand that does not matches any other hand. The tiebreaker rule is to compare the five cards one by one, from the most valuable to the least, until a hand presents a card with more value than the other.
                        One pair: two cards of the same type. The tiebreaker rule is similar to the high card’s rule, only that you compare first the pair and then the other cards.
                        Two pairs: two pairs. The tiebreaker rule is similar to the high card’s rule. You first compare the most valuable pair, then the least valuable pair and then the remaining card.
                        Three of a kind: three cards of the same value. The tiebreaker rule is similar to the one pair’s rule.
                        Straight: five cards sequence of consecutive values. In this case, the Ace can take the value of both the least valuable card (before the 2) or of the most valuable (after the king). The tiebreaker rule is done by the most valuable card on the straight. Note that the Ace is the least valuable card if it appears before the 2.
                        Flush: five cards of the same suit. The tiebreaker rule is the same of the high card’s rule.
                        Full House: a three of a kind and a pair. The tiebreaker rule is done by comparing first the values of the three of a kind. If the tie remains, the pair values must be compared.
                        Four of a kind: four cards with the same value. The tiebreaker rule is comparing the values of the four of a kind and then the remaining card.

The school’s system to determine each new student’s tutor was designed by a mad man called Succa Liaudzionis. Succa decided to use each student’s ID number to follow the pattern of a binary search tree (because reasons), like this:


	The first student, with ID X1, becomes the root of the tree and thus has no tutor.
	The numbers X2, X3, …, Xn are added one by one to the tree. To add a number Xi one must traverse the tree starting from the root and using the following rules:



	The pointer is initially set to the root of the tree.
	If Xi is smaller than the ID of the current node, then its left child becomes the current node. Otherwise, the right child does.
	If at some point the required child does not exist, the new node is created containing the value of Xi. The ID of the tutor of the current student is the parent Xi  in the tree.

                    The tour that follows the transitions (P, 1A), (P, 1A), (P, 1B), (Q, 2B) and ends in the state Q generates the word AABB and has cost 2.

2133;Dinostratus Numbers;Mathematics;9;"Recent archaeological discoveries of researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada, showed that a strange sequence of numbers were found on the walls of pyramids in Egypt, in ruins of Macchu Picchu and on the rocks of Stonehenge. Intrigued by the apparent coincidence, the researchers contacted the Department of Mathematics to decipher what was special about that sequence or numbers.

                    The discovery was stunning. All numbers were generated by matrices of Dinostratus. Dinostratus was a famous greek mathematician who lived from 390 to 320 BC and had worked in important geometry problems like squaring the circle. Dinostratus studied matrices M of size 3 x 3 formed by nine distinct integers with the property that for every position (i, j), i = 1 ,..., 3, j = 1 ,..., 3 of matrix, the element Mi,j is a multiple of its neighbors Mi-1,j, Mi-1,j-1 and Mi,j-1 (if they exist). In his honor, we say that N is a Dinostratus number if exist a matrix M with the property above such that M3,3 = N.

                    See an example for N = 36.

					A few minutes later, the group joined Tess. One of the visitors stepped up to Tess and said, “I hope you don’t mind, but I wanted to try it myself. Don’t worry, I just played with the x-scale and y-scale controls a little bit.” The next person said, “Sorry if this is a problem, but I really wanted to get a feel for the speed of display, so I just played around with the translation tool.” And a third person said, “I couldn’t resist just one tiny test: I rotated the image just so I could see all of the vertices snap to the nearest grid points after the rotation.”

					The person who played with the rotation tool remembered going first, but the other two could not recall their order. The three remembered only a few details of the changes. The x- and y-scaling factors had been (possibly negative) nonzero integers; the center of scaling was the origin (0, 0). The x- and y-translation amounts had been integers. Rotation had been specified by a point with integer coordinates (x, y) on the perimeter of a square of width 20 centered at the origin (hence, −10 ≤ x, y ≤ 10 and the absolute value of x or y or both was 10). The tool rotated the drawing around the origin such that the positive x-axis would pass through (x, y) afterwards. Snapping took place after this rotation (coordinates with a fractional part of 0.5 were rounded away from zero).

					After they left, Tess looked at her design – it was completely changed! She had not yet implemented the “undo” feature, and she had not saved the diagram prior to giving the demonstration. However, the three identical red dots were still there (transformed to other integer grid locations, of course), and Tess could remember the integer coordinates where she had originally placed them. Obviously, someone else might have altered the drawing without saying anything to her, but she could write a program to see if it was possible to reconstruct the sequence of alterations.

Unfortunately, opening the tomb turns out to be a bad idea: all of a sudden, what was just a few moments ago an empty desert has now become a desert crawling with grumpy mummies (you would be grumpy too if you were suddenly awakened after a few thousand years of peaceful sleep).2

					Faced with this murderous mass of mad mummies, your only chance is to run for it and try to escape before they catch you. The question is: how long will it take before a mummy catches you, assuming neither you nor the mummies ever get tired?

In your turns, you can move to any of the eight squares adjacent to your current location, or you can choose to stand still. In the mummies’ turns, each mummy simply moves to the adjacent square that brings it closest to you (measured by Euclidean distance, assuming that you and all the mummies stand in the centers of their respective squares). It is possible for two mummies to occupy the same square.

The height of such a pyramid equals the length of its base, which in this case is 10. We call this a high pyramid.

					If you think that a high pyramid is too steep, you can proceed as follows. On the 10 × 10 base square, lay an 8 × 8 square, then a 6 × 6 square, and so on, ending with a 2 × 2 top square (if you start with a base of odd length, you end up with a single cube on top, of course). The height of this pyramid is about half the length of its base. We call this a low pyramid.

Since manipulating the keys and rings is often an annoying task (and also dangerous to one’s fingernails), Adam is looking for a way to minimize the number of key and ring operations.

					Every key attachment, key detachment, ring connection, or ring disconnection is considered one operation. Since manipulating two rings is significantly easier than sliding a key, we first want to minimize the number of keys being detached and attached. Among solutions with the same minimal number of key operations, you need to find the one with the minimal number of ring connections and disconnections.

					When all the operations are complete, Adam and Brenda must each carry one connected group of rings and keys. The only exception is when either of them would have no keys at all—in such a case, no ring is needed. Each key must be attached to exactly one ring. Some rings (but not keys) may be considered leftovers and may remain disconnected from the two groups.

					The left side of the following figure shows an initial configuration consisting of four keys on three rings. Adam wishes to give Brenda the two keys labeled N and R. This can be accomplished by two key operations and one ring operation, resulting in the configuration shown on the right side of the figure.";"Each test case contains one or more lines, each containing a two letter string.

2211;Minimum Cost Flow;Ad-Hoc;1;"You have been hired to construct a system to transport water between two points in an old factory building using some existing components of the old plumbing. The old components consist of pipes and junctions. Junctions are points where pipes may have previously been joined. We say previously joined, because some of the old pipes were damaged and have been removed, effectively leaving open holes in the junctions to which they were connected. If water should enter one of these junctions, it would pour out of an open hole and eventually flood the building—clearly an undesirable event.

					You can remedy this situation by installing new pipes between some of the open holes and installing plugs to close other open holes as necessary. When you install a new pipe connecting two holes (which must be in two different junctions), the two holes are no longer open and water will be able to flow through the new pipe. The cost of installing a new pipe is equal to the distance between the centers of the two junctions the pipe connects. The cost of installing a plug in an open hole is 0.5. You are not concerned about open holes in junctions that will never be reached by water.

					Two of the junctions are special. One, called the source, is the point where water will be pumped into the new system. The other, called the destination, is where the water is needed. After any plugs and new pipes have been added to the system, water will be pumped into it at the source with a pressure sufficient to reach a specified height (in the absence of leaks, of course). You are allowed to select the pressure arbitrarily, and are guaranteed that the pressure will not change during the operation of the system. Naturally the pressure must be sufficient to force water up to the heights of both the source and the destination. Your task is simply to find the most inexpensive way of getting water from the source junction to the destination junction without flooding the building.

					The figure below corresponds to the first sample input case, where black dots represent open holes, junction 1 is the source, and junction 7 is the destination. (The position of a black dot on its circle has no significance and is used for illustration purposes only.)

					  

					Water flows through the system according to the laws of physics. If the pressure is sufficient to fill a junction with water, then that junction will remain filled with water. If there are pipes extending horizontally or downward from a junction, then water will also flow through those pipes. Water will also flow upward through pipes connected to a junction up to the height determined by the water pressure. Of course, if the water reaches an open hole in a junction, it will flow through the hole and flood the building.

					In the first sample input case, you can connect junctions 1 and 5 at a cost of 3, plug the open holes in junction 2, and set the pressure so that the water flows up to junction 7 only. The water will fill junctions 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7, and will flow no higher. A different (more expensive) solution would be to simply plug all the holes at a total cost of 5, and let the water flow through all the junctions. You cannot solve this case by connecting junctions 1 and 6 and plugging holes in junctions 2 and 5, since junction 6 has no open holes to which a new pipe can be connected.

					Assume existing pipes and any new pipes do not interfere with each other or with any junctions, except those to which they are connected.

2214;Shortest Flight Path;Ad-Hoc;1;"Commercial flights are statistically quite safe (in terms of number of deaths per passenger-kilometer, only going to the moon is safer). But there are still reasons for precautions and safety regulations. An early such rule was the so-called “60-minute rule,” which required that a two-engine plane must always be within 60 minutes of the nearest adequate airport along its entire flight path. A variety of similar rules have existed, but at their core, they remain the same: the flight path can not take the airplane more than a certain maximum allowed distance from the nearest airport. With these restrictions, planes cannot always use a direct route for flying from one airport to another.

					In this problem we will compute the shortest flight path between two airports while adhering to a maximum allowed distance rule. In the figure below, which illustrates the first sample test case, any flight route has to stay within the three circles. Thus a plane going from airport 2 to airport 3 has to detour from the direct route via the region around airport 1. Note that the plane would not necessarily have to go to airport 1 itself.

					 

					Things are further complicated by the fact that planes have limited fuel supply, and to go longer distances they may need to make a stopover at intermediate airports. Thus, depending on the fuel capacity, a plane going from airport 2 to airport 3 in the figure might have to stop over at airport 1 (or the fuel capacity might be too low even to go to airport 1, in which case the trip would be impossible to make).

					We make the following simplifying assumptions:

					
						The surface of the earth is a sphere of radius 6370 km.
						Both time and fuel consumption are directly proportional to distance traveled. In other words we are interested only in total distance traveled.
						The difference in distance caused by planes flying at different altitudes is negligible. Thus, effectively, we assume them to be flying along the earth’s surface.
						A plane may stop for refueling at as many intermediate airports as needed, each time getting a full tank.";"The first line of each test case contains two integers N and R, where 2 ≤ N ≤ 25 is the number of airports and 1 ≤ R ≤ 10 000 is the maximum allowed flight distance (in km) from the nearest airport.

2215;Stacking Plates;Ad-Hoc;1;"The Plate Shipping Company is an Internet retailer that, as their name suggests, exclusively sells plates. They pride themselves in offering the widest selection of dinner plates in the universe from a large number of manufacturers.

					In a recent cost analysis the company has discovered that they spend a large amount of money on packing the plates for shipment. Part of the reason is that plates have to be stacked before being put into shipping containers. And apparently, this is taking more time than expected. Maybe you can help.

					A shipment of plates consists of plates from several manufacturers. The plates from each manufacturer come stacked, that is, each arranged in a single stack with plates ordered by size (the smallest at the top, the largest at the bottom). We will call such a stack properly ordered. To ship all these plates, you must combine them into a single stack, again properly ordered. To join the manufacturers’ stacks into a single stack, two kinds of operations are allowed:

					
						Split: a single stack can be split into two stacks by lifting any top portion of the stack and putting it aside to form a new stack.
						Join: two stacks can be joined by putting one on top of the other. This is allowed only if the bottom plate of the top stack is no larger than the top plate of the bottom stack, that is, the joined stack has to be properly ordered.
					

					Note that a portion of any stack may never be put directly on top of another stack. It must first be split and then the split portion must be joined with the other stack. Given a collection of stacks, you have to find the minimum number of operations that transforms them into a single stack. The following example corresponds to the sample input, and shows how two stacks can be transformed to a single stack in five operations:";Each test case starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), the number of stacks that have to be combined for a shipment. This is followed by n lines, each describing a stack. These lines start with an integer h (1 ≤ h ≤ 50), the height of the stack. This number is followed by h positive integers that give the diameters of the plates, from top to bottom. All diameters are at most 10 000.

The aim in this war is simply to drive the competition out of the market. There are N subsidiaries of Takeover Incorporated and M subsidiaries of Buyout Limited, and you know the market value of each subsidiary.

					Each company can designate one of its subsidiaries to perform a takeover. The takeover can either be friendly or hostile. A friendly takeover means a subsidiary of a corporation merges with a different subsidiary of the same corporation. The market value of the merged subsidiary is the sum of the market values of the constituent subsidiaries. There is no constraint on the relative sizes of the subsidiaries participating in a friendly takeover.

					A hostile takeover means a subsidiary A of a corporation attempts to take over a subsidiary B of the other corporation. For this to succeed, the market value of A has to be greater than the market value of B. After this move, B disappears from the market. The market value of A does not change (the gain of incorporating B’s assets is offset by the monetary cost of the takeover). For simplicity we assume that no sequence of moves leads to two subsidiaries of different corporations having the same market value.

					The companies take turns making moves in this takeover war, with Takeover Incorporated going first. A company will do nothing on its turn only if it cannot make a takeover. A company loses the takeover war if all its subsidiaries are taken over.

In the second case, Takeover has to make a friendly takeover in its first move. Buyout Limited will join its two subsidiaries into a single company with market value 10. Takeover will have to make a friendly takeover again (as again it will not have a large enough subsidiary to take over Buyout’s giant).

The four edges of the square represent the surfaces on which the molecule can connect to other compatible molecules.

					In each test case, you will be given a set of molecule descriptions. Each type of molecule is described by four two-character connector labels that indicate how its edges can connect to the edges of other molecules. There are two types of connector labels:

					
						An uppercase letter (A, . . . , Z) followed by + or −. Two edges are compatible if their labels have the same letter but different signs. For example, A+ is compatible with A− but is not compatible with A+ or B−.
						Two zero digits 00. An edge with this label is not compatible with any edge (not even with another edge labeled 00).
					

					Assume there is an unlimited supply of molecules of each type, which may be rotated and reflected. As the molecules assemble themselves into larger structures, the edges of two molecules may be adjacent to each other only if they are compatible.

Surprisingly, it does not matter how much power each chip gets, but a machine works best when its two chips have power outputs as close as possible. The power output of a chip is simply the smallest power output of its k batteries.

					You have a stockpile of 2nk batteries that you want to assign to the chips. It might not be possible to allocate the batteries so that in every machine both chips have equal power outputs, but you want to allocate them so that the differences are as small as possible. To be precise, you want to tell your customers that in all machines the difference of power outputs of the two chips is at most d, and you want to make d as small as possible. To do this you must determine an optimal allocation of the batteries to the machines.

					Consider Sample Input 1. There are 2 machines, each requiring 3 batteries per chip, and a supply of batteries with power outputs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. You can, for instance, assign the batteries with power outputs 1, 3, 5 to one chip, those with power 2, 4, 12 to the other chip of the same machine, those with power 6, 8, 9 to the third chip, and those with power 7, 10, 11 to the fourth. The power outputs of the chips are 1, 2, 6, and 7, respectively, and the difference between power outputs is 1 in both machines. Note that there are many other ways to achieve this result.";The input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of two lines.

2261;Map Tiles;Ad-Hoc;1;"Publishing maps is not an easy task. First you need some appropriate transformation to display the earth’s spherical shape in a two-dimensional plane. Then another issue arises – most high-quality maps are too large to be printed on a single page of paper. To cope with that, map publishers often split maps into several rectangular tiles, and print each tile on one page. In this problem, you will examine this “tiling” process.

					The International Cartographic Publishing Company (ICPC) needs to cut their printing costs by minimizing the number of tiles used for their maps. Even with a fixed tile size (determined by the page size) and map scale, you can still optimize the situation by adjusting the tile grid.

					The left side of Figure G.1 shows 14 map tiles covering a region. The right side shows how you can cover the same region with only 10 tiles, without changing the tile sizes or orientation.

					  

					Figure G.1: Two possible ways of tiling Texas.

					Your task is to help the ICPC find the minimum number of tiles needed to cover a given region. For simplicity, the region will be given as a closed polygon that does not intersect itself.

					Note that the tiles must be part of a rectangular grid aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. That is, they touch each other only with their whole sides and cannot be rotated. Also note that although all input coordinates are integers, tiles may be located at non-integer coordinates.

					The polygon may touch the edges of marginal lines (as in Sample Input 2). However, to avoid floatingpoint issues, you may assume the optimal answer will not change even if the polygon is allowed to go outside the map tiles by a distance of 10−6 .";The input consists of a single test case. The first line of a test case contains three integers: n, xs, and ys. The number of polygon vertices is n (3 ≤ n ≤ 50), and xs and ys (1 ≤ xs, ys ≤ 100) are the dimensions of each tile. Each of the next n lines contains two integers x and y (0 ≤ x ≤ 10xs, 0 ≤ y ≤ 10ys), specifying the vertices of the polygon representing the region (in either clockwise or counter-clockwise order).;Display the minimal number of tiles necessary to cover the whole interior of the polygon.;True;1 / 10;4;3;75.00%
2262;Matryoshka;Ad-Hoc;10;"Matryoshkas are sets of traditional Russian wooden dolls of decreasing size placed one inside the other. A matryoshka doll can be opened to reveal a smaller figure of the same sort inside, which has, in turn, another figure inside, and so on.

					

					The Russian Matryoshka Museum recently exhibited a collection of similarly designed matryoshka sets, differing only in the number of nested dolls in each set. Unfortunately, some over-zealous (and obviously unsupervised) children separated these sets, placing all the individual dolls in a row. There are n dolls in the row, each with an integer size. You need to reassemble the matryoshka sets, knowing neither the number of sets nor the number of dolls in each set. You know only that every complete set consists of dolls with consecutive sizes from 1 to some number m, which may vary between the different sets.

					When reassembling the sets, you must follow these rules:

					
						You can put a doll or a nested group of dolls only inside a larger doll.
						You can combine two groups of dolls only if they are adjacent in the row.
						Once a doll becomes a member of a group, it cannot be transferred to another group or permanently separated from the group. It can be temporarily separated only when combining two groups.
					

					Your time is valuable, and you want to do this reassembly process as quickly as possible. The only time-consuming part of this task is opening and subsequently closing a doll, so you want to minimize how often you do this. For example, the minimum number of openings (and subsequent closings) when combining group [1, 2, 6] with the group [4] is two, since you have to open the dolls with sizes 6 and 4. When combining group [1, 2, 5] with the group [3, 4], you need to perform three openings.

2263;Pirate Chest;Ad-Hoc;7;"Pirate Dick finally had enough of fighting, marauding, theft, and making life miserable for many on the open seas. So he decided to retire, and he found the perfect island to spend the rest of his days on, provided he does not run out of money. He has plenty of gold coins now, and he wants to store them in a chest (he is a pirate after all). Dick can construct a rectangular chest with integer dimensions of any size up to a specified maximum size for the top but with an arbitrary integer height. Now he needs a place to hide the chest. While exploring the island, he found the perfect solution.

					Dick will hide his chest by submerging it in a murky pond. The pond has a rectangular surface, and it completely fills the bottom of a valley that has high vertical rocky walls. Dick surveyed the pond and knows its depth for each of the squares of a Cartesian coordinate grid system placed on the pond surface. When Dick submerges the chest, it will sink as far as possible until it touches the bottom. The top of the chest will remain parallel to the pond’s surface and the chest will be aligned with the grid squares. The water displaced by the submerged chest will raise the level of the pond’s surface (this will occur even if there is no space around the chest for the displaced water to rise). The walls of the valley are high enough that the water can never splash out of the valley. Of course, since the chest must be invisible, its top must be strictly below the surface of the pond. Your job is to find the volume of the largest chest that Pirate Dick can hide this way.

					In Figure I.1, the leftmost image shows a pond, the middle image shows a possible placement of a chest of volume 3, and the rightmost image shows a placement of a chest of volume 4, which is the maximum possible volume. Note that if the second chest were made one unit taller, its top would be visible because it would be at exactly the same height as the surface of the water.

2265;Up a Tree;Ad-Hoc;1;"Anatoly Cheng McDougal is a typical student in many ways. Whenever possible he tries to cut and paste code instead of writing it from scratch. Unavoidably this approach causes him problems. For example, when he first learned about preorder, inorder and postorder traversals of trees, and was given code for a preorder print of a tree (shown on the left below), he simply cut and pasted the code, then moved the print statement to the correct location and renamed the procedure. However, he forgot to rename the procedure calls inside the code, resulting in the defective inorder print and postorder print code shown below.

					  

					At this point, Anatoly did not behave like a typical student. He actually tested his code! Unfortunately, when the results were not correct, he reverted back to typical student behavior. He panicked and started randomly changing calls in all three procedures, hoping to get things right. Needless to say, the situation became even worse now than when he started.

					Anatoly’s professor tested the code on a random tree of characters. When she looked at the output of his three print routines, she correctly guessed what had happened. However, instead of going directly to his code, she decided to try to reconstruct Anatoly’s code just by observing the output. In order to do this, she correctly made the following assumptions:

					
						The output statement in each print routine is in the correct location (for example, between the two recursive calls in the inPrint routine).
						Among the six recursive calls made by the three routines, exactly two calls are to prePrint, exactly two are to inPrint, and exactly two are to postPrint, though potentially in the wrong routines.
					

					Soon the professor realized that reconstructing Anatoly’s code and the test tree from his output was not a simple task and that the result might be ambiguous.

In addition, for each such reconstruction, you are to find the alphabetically first tree (as described in the output section) giving the observed output.";The input consists of a single test case. A test case consists of three strings on three separate lines: the observed output of Anatoly’s prePrint, inPrint and postPrint routines (in that order) on some test tree. Each of these strings consists of n uppercase letters (4 ≤ n ≤ 26), with no repeated letters in any string. The test case is guaranteed to have at least one solution.;"Display all possible reconstructions for the test case, ordered as described in the last paragraph below.

The calls are described by the words Pre, In, and Post, separated by spaces. For example, if Anatoly’s routines were correct, the resulting output of the first part of the reconstruction would be Pre Pre In In Post Post.

In another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other.

The Hamming distance is named after Richard Hamming, who introduced it in his fundamental paper on Hamming codes Error detecting and error correcting codes in 1950.

It is used in telecommunication to count the number of flipped bits in a fixed-length binary word as an estimate of error, and therefore is sometimes called the signal distance. Hamming weight analysis of bits is used in several disciplines including information theory, coding theory, and cryptography.

For example , the binary representation of 910 is 10012 and 1010 is 10102 therefore distance Hamming between them is 2 because you only need to switch the last two bits 10012 to turn in 10102.

Na fazenda, a área destinada às pesquisas é de formato retangular, dividida em células quadradas de mesmo tamanho. Em cada célula é criada apenas uma espécie de minhoca. As células são utilizadas para testar os efeitos, sobre a produção de minhocas, de variações de espécies de minhoca, de tipos de terra, de adubo, de umidade, etc. Os pesquisadores da OBM mantêm um acompanhamento constante do desenvolvimento das minhocas em cada célula, e têm uma estimativa extremamente precisa da produtividade de cada uma das células.

2298;Mini-Poker;Ad-Hoc;6;"Mini-Poker é o nome de um jogo de cartas que é uma simplificação de Poker, um dos mais famosos jogos de cartas do mundo. Mini-Poker é jogado com um baralho normal de 52 cartas, com quatro naipes (copas, paus, espadas e ouro), cada naipe compreendendo treze cartas (Ás, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Valete, Dama, Rei).

No início do jogo, cada jogador recebe cinco cartas. O conjunto de cinco cartas vale um certo número de pontos, de acordo com as regras descritas abaixo. Diferentemente do jogo de Poker normal, em Mini-Poker o naipe das cartas é desconsiderado. Assim, para simplificar a descrição do jogo, vamos utilizar os números de 1 a 13 para identificar as cartas do baralho, na ordem dada acima. Uma outra diferença é que pode ocorrer empate entre mais de um vencedor; nesse caso os vencedores dividem o prêmio.

As regras para pontuação em Mini-Poker são as seguintes:


	Se as cinco cartas estão em seqüência a partir da carta x (ou seja, os valores das cartas são x, x+1, x+2, x+3 e x+4), a pontuação é x+200 pontos. Por exemplo, se as cartas recebidas são 10, 9, 8, 11 e 12, a pontuação é 208 pontos.
	Se há quatro cartas iguais x (uma quadra, ou seja, os valores das cartas são x, x, x, x e y), a pontuação é x+180 pontos. Por exemplo, se as cartas recebidas são 1, 1, 1, 10 e 1, a pontuação é 181 pontos.
	Se há três cartas iguais x e duas outras cartas iguais y (uma trinca e um par, ou seja, os valores das cartas são x, x, x, y e y), a pontuação é x + 160 pontos. Por exemplo, se as cartas recebidas são 10, 4, 4, 10 e 4, a pontuação é 164 pontos.
	Se há três cartas iguais x e duas outras cartas diferentes y e z (uma trinca, ou seja, os valores das cartas são x, x, x, y e z), a pontuação é x + 140 pontos. Por exemplo, se as cartas recebidas são 2, 3, 2, 2 e 13, a pontuação é 142 pontos.
	Se há duas cartas iguais x, duas outras cartas iguais y (x != y) e uma outra carta distinta z (dois pares, ou seja, os valores das cartas são x, x, y, y e z), a pontuação é 3 × x + 2 × y + 20 pontos, em que x > y. Por exemplo, se as cartas recebidas são 12, 7, 12, 8 e 7, a pontuação é 70 pontos.
	Se há apenas duas cartas iguais x e as outras são todas distintas (um par, ou seja, os valores das cartas são x, x, y, z e t), a pontuação é x pontos. Por exemplo, se as cartas recebidas são 12, 13, 5, 8 e 13, a pontuação é 13 pontos.

A colheita é sempre feita em um único lote, coletando-se todas as margaridas daquele lote que estejam prontas para a venda. Uma semana antes de fazer a colheita, os funcionários da plantação analisaram cada vaso e anotaram quantas margaridas estarão prontas para venda na semana seguinte. Leopoldo agora precisa da sua ajuda para determinar qual o número máximo de margaridas que poderá ser colhido em um único lote de M × N vasos.

After each jump, the judges, who don't communicate with each other, show their scores. A dive is evaluated between zero and ten by each judge. After the scores are presented, the highest and the lowest scores are discarded. The remaining scores are added and the sum is multiplied by the degree of difficulty of the dive, which is a number between 1.2 and 3.8 defined before the dive. So, for example, assuming a diver's jump has difficulty 2.0 and his scores are 6,0, 5,0, 5,0, 5,0, 5,0, 5,0 and 4,0. Discarding the highest and lowest scores, we get to a result of 25.0.

Um móbile é uma estrutura composta de peças unidas por fios. O móbile é preso por um fio a uma argola pela qual ele é suspenso, permitindo que a estrutura movimente-se livremente. A argola é presa a uma única peça, chamada de peça-raiz do móbile. A peça-raiz pode ter zero ou mais sub-móbiles pendurados nela, cada sub-móbile sendo composto por uma peça-raiz na qual por sua vez podem estar pendurados zero ou mais sub-móbiles, e assim sucessivamente. Abaixo podemos ver dois exemplos de móbiles:

					 

					Victor é dono de uma fabrica de móbiles que emprega centenas de artesãos. Cada móbile produzido na fábrica é confeccionado por um artesão, que cria móbiles de acordo com o seu gosto pessoal, utilizando peças de formatos distintos. Entretanto, Victor tem notado que nem todos os seus artesãos possuem a mesma habilidade artística, de forma que às vezes o móbile produzido nem sempre é bem balanceado, segundo a sua concepção. Para Victor, um móbile é bem balanceado se, para cada peça, todos os sub-móbiles pendurados nela são compostos pelo mesmo número de peças. O número de peças de um sub-móbile é determinado contando-se o número de peças que o compõe, incluindo a sua peça-raiz. Note que cada peça do móbile, exceto a peça-raiz, é pendurada em exatamente uma outra peça.

					Por exemplo, o móbile da figura (a) acima é um móbile bem balanceado: a peça-raiz possui um único sub-móbile, que por sua vez possui três sub-móbiles, todos com o mesmo número de peças (uma única). Já o móbile da figura (b) é um móbile mal balanceado: a peça-raiz possui dois sub-móbiles, um com o total de duas peças e outro com o total de uma peça.

Para a ﬁnal da OBI, a coordenação estava pensando em providenciar pão a metro para os competidores, porém tais problemas os ﬁzeram recuar na idéia.

					Embora a idéia tenha sido momentaneamente abandonada, uma idéia simples surgiu: cortar previamente o pão em fatias de tamanho iguais e distribuí-las entre as pessoas. O único problema com tal idéia é que se o número de pessoas for muito grande, ﬁca impraticável ter apenas um pão. Por exemplo, se quisermos que 1.000 pessoas recebam 20 centímetros de sanduíche, seria necessário um sanduíche de 20.000 centímetros, ou 200 metros!

A questão seria: qual o tamanho inteiro máximo que essas fatias poderão ter?

					Por exemplo, se tivermos K = 4, com os tamanhos (em centímetros) M1 = 120, M2 = 89, M3 = 230 e M4 = 177 e N = 10, podemos retirar N fatias iguais de tamanho máximo 57, pois assim conseguimos 2 fatias no primeiro pão, 1 no segundo, 4 no terceiro e 3 no quarto, totalizando as 10 fatias necessárias. Se tentarmos cortar fatias de tamanho 58, só será possível obter 3 fatias do terceiro pão, totalizando 9 e, portanto, 57 é realmente o melhor que podemos obter. Note que não podemos usar duas ou mais fatias menores de diferentes pães para formarmos uma fatia do tamanho selecionado. (ﬁcaria muito deselegante dar um lanche recortado às pessoas).

						Inicialmente, todos os vendedores estão inativos.
						Sempre que um vendedor realizar uma ligação, ele ficará ocupado pelos T minutos descritos na lista para aquela ligação. O tempo entre duas ligações consecutivas as do mesmo vendedor é desprezível.
						Um vendedor não pode fazer mais de uma ligação ao mesmo tempo.
						Um vendedor que esteja inativo deverá fazer a ligação que estiver no topo da lista. Caso mais de um vendedor esteja inativo no mesmo instante, o vendedor com o menor identificador dentre os vendedores inativos deverá fazer a ligação que estiver no topo da lista.
						Assim que uma ligação é atribuída a um vendedor, ela é removida da lista.
						Um vendedor fica inativo sempre que termina uma ligação.

Calculation of areas, perimeters, side measures, Arquibaldo was tired of small challenges. For him, it was all very easy. His aunt Helena, however, being a math english teacher, decided to give him a little harder challenge. Helena showed him four identical triangles and formed with them a square such that their sides were the measures of the hypotenuse of the chosen triangles. Then she told the nephew that depending on the measures of right triangles, there may or there may not be a smaller square in the center of the second largest. The illustrations below show clearly these cases:



She challenged him: ""If I give the sides of the inner and outer square, l1 and l2, for example, can you tell me the smallest internal angle's measure, in degrees, of the triangle that would form with three other identical triangles a square with side mesure l1 and other with side mesure l2? "". Arquibaldo, has started to solve the challenge. Because he can't use calculator, her aunt was a good girl and allowed that only the integer parte of the answer was presented, ie, without decimal places. This way, Arquibaldo has now to find the greatest integer measure of the right triangle's smaller angle, such that the side of the inner square made by this new triangle (with the inner angle's measure being integer) be greater or equal to the inner square's side, that is, this should ""fit"" in the new inner square. For example, if the sides of the inner and outer squares have measures 1 and 5, respectively, then the smallest angle will approximate measure of 36,87º (degrees), however, the greatest integer measure is 36, because for a set of four angles of right triangles 36 and 54 (complement) form squares of side 5 and 1,10 units of measure, that is, the square of side 1 would ""fit"" in a square of side 1.10, with this angle.

""Watch out for the existence of the triangle! Remember: now the angle measurements can only be integer numbers, ""warned Helena to Arquibaldo for possible mistakes because she's brother. In the above example, the triangle has angles of 36, 54 and 90 degrees.

Nesta semana ele viu o anúncio de um evento inusitado: uma feira de bactérias. Nessa feira, vários fornecedores estarão vendendo diferentes tipos de bactérias. Cada tipo de bactéria é vendido em uma placa de vidro, já preparada para a formação de uma colônia de bactérias. Cada placa de vidro é vendida com apenas uma bactéria inicialmente.

Bruno deu uma olhada no catálogo com os tipos de bactérias que estarão à venda na feira, e notou algumas coisas interessantes:


	Todos os tipos de bactérias à venda terão o mesmo preço.
	Todas as bactérias (de todos os tipos) se subdividem todas as noites para gerar outras bactérias. Por exemplo, a bactéria da colônia de tipo X se subdivide em 2 outras bactérias todas as noites. Assim, no primeiro dia teremos só uma bactéria na colônia. No dia seguinte, teremos 2, e no próximo, 4. A quantidade de divisões de uma bactéria depende do seu tipo.
	O crescimento da colônia cessa após um determinado número de dias, por causa da escassez de alimento. A quantidade de dias em que uma colônia cresce depende do tipo de bactéria.


É final de mês e Bruno já gastou quase todo o seu dinheiro. Assim, resolveu que irá comprar apenas uma colônia de bactérias. No entanto, ele pretende comprar a colônia que forneça a maior quantidade de bactérias ao final do período de crescimento da mesma.

2348;Dating On-Line;Ad-Hoc;3;"Alex registered in an online dating system to search for the perfect partner. The system requires each of its members to fill a form specifying how much they enjoy N different activities, grading them on a scale from 0 to 100. To present this information to potential dates, the system creates a profile featuring a special kind of polygon called “radial diagram”.

A radial diagram for N activities is drawn by marking N points on the plane. Starting from the vertical direction, the i-th point in clockwise order represents the i-th activity specified by the member, and is a distance Si away from the center of the diagram, where Si is the score given by the member for the corresponding activity. The angle sustained at the center of the diagram from each pair of consecutive points is always the same, and the polygon is formed by drawing the segments whose endpoints are consecutive points. Note that for the purposes of the radial diagram, the first and last points are considered to be consecutive.

For example, if N = 6 Alex might specify the following activities: singing with score S1 = 10, running with score S2 = 60, listening to music with score S3 = 70, traveling with score S4 = 70, eating out with score S5 = 80, and visiting museums with score S6 = 80. Then the corresponding radial diagram would be as shown in the figure below.



The area of a radial diagram depends on the order in which the different activities are specified, and Alex suspects that a profile depicting a radial diagram with greater area might be more successful.

Since the farmer thinks his nephew is a smart boy, he took his advice and bought a robot scarecrow. The robot moves along a pathway that surrounds the corn field.

Num ambiente muito escuro, a pupila pode atingir um diâmetro de 8 mm.

					Cada objeto celeste (estrela, planeta, nebulosa, etc) emite uma quantidade de luz (fótons) que é homogeneamente distribuída quando chega na Terra. Por exemplo, a estrela A emite luz que pode ser captada a um fluxo de 40.000 fótons por segundo por milímetro quadrado. Isso é, a cada segundo, é possível captar 40.000 fótons provenientes da estrela A numa área de 1 mm 2. Ou seja, uma pupila de 10 mm 2 de área captaria 400.000 fótons provenientes da estrela A por segundo.

					Para que nosso cérebro consiga interpretar que existe um objeto ali, porém, ele precisa receber 40.000.000 fótons por segundo. Assim, podemos utilizar um telescópio com lente (ou espelho) de 100 mm 2 de área, que vai captar a quantidade necessária de fótons provenientes da estrela A e encaminhá-los até nossa pupila, fazendo assim com que nosso cérebro perceba a presença da estrela ali.

2391;Progressões Aritméticas;Ad-Hoc;3;"Bob é um aluno do ensino médio que gosta muito de matemática. Na última aula ele aprendeu o que são Progressões Aritméticas (PAs) e ficou fascinado por elas. Pelo que Bob entendeu, Progressões Aritméticas são sequências de números nas quais a diferença entre dois elementos consecutivos é sempre igual a uma constante r, chamada de razão da PA.

Um exemplo de Progressão Aritmética de razão 2 é −1, 1, 3, 5. Além disso, toda sequência com um ou dois elementos é sempre uma Progressão Aritmética. Por outro lado, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 não é uma PA porque a diferença entre elementos consecutivos não é constante: a diferença entre os dois primeiros elementos é 6−5 = 1, enquanto a diferença entre o terceiro e o segundo elementos é 8−6 = 2.

Bob percebeu que qualquer sequência, mesmo que a mesma não seja uma Progressão Aritmética, pode ser quebrada em sequências menores que são PAs. Por exemplo, vimos que a sequência 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 não é uma PA, mas podemos quebrar ela entre o 6 e o 8 para obtermos as sequências 5, 6 e 8, 9, 10, que são PAs. Note que não existe como quebrar a sequência em menos partes se quisermos ter apenas PAs no fim do procedimento.

Bob é fascinado por programação mas ainda não sabe programar muito bem, e por isso pediu sua ajuda: ele não está conseguindo descobrir como quebrar sequências muito grandes de um jeito eficiente; por isso, pediu que você escrevesse um programa para, dada uma sequência qualquer, imprimir o número mínimo de partes em que precisamos quebrar a sequência para termos apenas Progressões Aritméticas no término do processo. Caso a sequência original já seja uma PA, podemos terminar o processo com uma única parte, e portanto a resposta para esse caso é 1.

É fácil verificar que a sequência −2, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6 (do segundo caso de teste abaixo) não é uma PA, pois 2−0 ≠ 3−2. Verificando manualmente, você pode constatar que não é possível particionar a sequência em duas de tal forma que ambas as partes sejam PAs. Entretanto, existe uma maneira de particionar a sequência em 3 PAs: [−2, 0, 2] [3, 3] [4, 6]. Portanto, temos que a resposta para este exemplo é 3.

No terceiro caso de teste abaixo, a sequência −2, 0, 3, 6 pode ser particionada de várias formas. As únicas maneiras que resultam em PAs são as seguintes:


	Com 4 partes temos 1 possibilidade:
	[−2] [0] [3] [6]
	
	Com 3 partes temos 3 possibilidades:
	[−2, 0] [3] [6]

2392;Pulo do Sapo;Ad-Hoc;3;"Sebastião Bueno Coelho, apelidado de SBC pelos familiares e amigos, passou as férias de janeiro de 2011 no sítio de seus avós. Durante sua estadia, uma das atividades prediletas do SBC era nadar no rio que havia no fundo da casa onde morava.

Uma das características do rio que mais impressionava SBC era um belo caminho, feito inteiramente com pedras brancas. Há muito tempo, o avô de SBC notara que os habitantes do sítio atravessavam o rio com grande frequência e, por isso, construiu um caminho no rio com pedras posicionadas em linha reta; ao fazê-lo, tomou muito cuidado para que o espaçamento das pedras fosse de exatamente um metro.

Hoje em dia, a única utilidade do caminho é servir de diversão para os sapos que vivem no rio, que pulam de uma pedra a outra agitadamente. Um certo dia, enquanto descansava e nadava nas águas, SBC assistiu atentamente às acrobacias dos bichos e notou que cada sapo sempre pulava (zero, uma ou mais vezes) uma quantidade fixa de metros.

SBC sabe que você participa da OBI todos os anos e, chegando na escola, resolveu desafiar-te com o seguinte problema: Dado o número de pedras no rio, o número de sapos, a pedra inicial sobre a qual cada sapo está (cada pedra é identificada por sua posição na sequência de pedras) e a distância que cada sapo pula, determinar as posições onde pode existir um sapo depois que SBC chega no rio.

SBC também lhe disse que o primeiro sapo da entrada sempre pula 2 metros, e o segundo sempre pula 4 metros. A figura a seguir ilustra as possíveis pedras que podem ser ocupadas pelos sapos quando eles começam a pular.



No segundo caso de teste abaixo, SBC indicou a existência de 8 pedras no rio e 3 sapos. Os sapos estavam inicialmente nas pedras 3, 2 e 6. SBC também lhe disse que o primeiro sapo da entrada sempre pula 3 metros, o segundo e terceiro sempre pulam 2 metros. Dessa forma, o primeiro sapo pode estar nas pedras 3 ou 6; o segundo sapo pode estar nas pedras 2, 4, 6 ou 8; e o terceiro sapo pode estar nas pedras 6, 4, 2 e 8.

Ultimamente, a população desse arquipélago tem aumentado drasticamente, o que levou a um grande aumento da pesca, e, consequentemente, a problemas.

Neste arquipélago, cada pescador vai diariamente ao alto mar com a intenção de conseguir trazer o maior número de peixes para o seu vilarejo. Com a expansão da pesca, os pescadores estão começando a jogar suas redes de pesca por cima das de outros pescadores. Com isso, os pescadores perdem, pois apenas o primeiro pescador pega os peixes da intersecção entre as redes.

A Associação dos Pescadores da ilha decidiu fazer um levantamento para descobrir quanto do mar está de fato sendo aproveitado, ou seja, qual a área do mar que está coberta por pelo menos uma rede de pesca.

Como há muitas intersecções entre as redes de pesca, é muito difícil para a associação calcular a área total da região coberta pelas redes. Por este motivo, eles pediram para que você escrevesse um programa para resolver este problema.

Para desafogar o trânsito, o prefeito de Brisbane e o governador de Queensland decidiram que uma nova capital administrativa deve ser construída em uma área fora de Brisbane. Para projetar a nova capital, o renomado arquiteto minimalista Joe Bloggs foi contratado.

Bloggs foi informado de que o terreno destinado à nova capital ainda não foi demarcado, mas será retangular. Além disso, a cidade deverá ser dividida em quatro zonas, uma delas destinada a uma reserva ambiental e cada uma das outras três receberá os novos prédios de cada um dos três poderes (Executivo, Legislativo e Judiciário). Em um arroubo de criatividade, Bloggs decidiu que duas avenidas, perpendiculares entre si, cada uma paralela a dois dos lados do terreno retangular, dividirão a capital nas quatro zonas.

Bloggs recebeu do governo as áreas de cada uma das zonas e, após muito esforço, encontrou um retângulo que pode ser dividido conforme seus planos e de forma a respeitar as áreas delimitadas. No entanto, a Fundação de Conservação dos Cangurus determinou que a área destinada à reserva ambiental era muito pequena, o que obrigou o governo a alterar as áreas das quatro zonas.

2430;Catálogo de Músicas;Ad-Hoc;2;"Joyce é uma menina que gosta muito de ouvir música, e possui uma enorme coleção de músicas num dvd. Ela é uma menina organizada e deixa suas músicas em pastas, mas como o número de músicas e de pastas é grandre, Joyce construiu um catálogo para melhor localizá-las.

Para o catálogo Joyce utilizou uma convenção usual em sistemas operacionais, em que a descrição da localiza- ção de cada arquivo é formada pela sequência dos nomes das pastas no caminho da raiz do dvd até o arquivo, separados pelo caractere barra (‘/’). Por exemplo, na figura abaixo, a descrição da música Sampa.mp3 no catálogo é MPB/Caetano/Sampa.mp3.



Utilizando essa convenção, o catálogo do dvd mostrado na figura é:

Rock/AngraCarryOn.mp3

MPB/Caetano/Sampa.mp3

MPB/Cartola/Alvorada.mp3

Como o dvd de Joyce tem muitas músicas e pastas, o catálogo é muito grande. Joyce notou no entanto que o catálogo poderia ser menor (ter um número menor de caracteres) caso ela utilizasse outro conceito usual na nomeação de arquivos em sistemas operacionais: usar uma pasta como referência, ao invés da raiz.

Se uma pasta diferente da raiz for escolhida como referência, então para todos os arquivos que estejam diretamente nessa pasta ou em alguma subpasta não será mais necessário escrever o nome da pasta referência no catálogo. Para as demais pastas, é necessário indicar o caminho utilizando as pastas acima (na direção da raiz) utilizando a convenção ‘../’ para a pasta imediatamente acima da pasta referência. No exemplo da figura acima, no caso de a referência ser a pasta Caetano, a música Sampa.mp3 seria simplesmente descrita como Sampa.mp3. Já a música Alvorada.mp3 seria descrita como ../Cartola/Alvorada.mp3.

Assim, se a pasta Caetano for utilizada como referência, o catálogo será:

2507;Hamming Code;Ad-Hoc;10;"The Hamming code allows detection and correction of 1-bit error in reading data. Let's consider 16-bit words. In the table below is the word 4ac5hex in its binary form, each bit has its position number indicated:



In Hamming coding, the numbering of the bit positions uses a count in which the position values ​​that are power of 2: 1, 2, 4, ..., are reserved for inserting parity bits. These bits will be used as parity for Hamming coding. In the above case it would be:




To calculate the parity of each hamming bit we use the bits according to their position. For example, the bit of position 11 will influence the hamming bits: 8, 2 and 1, because 11 = 8 + 2 + 1. For parity bit 2, we take all bits that influence this parity. For a 16-bit word they are: 3 (2 + 1), 6 (4 + 2), 7 (4 + 2 + 1), 10, 11, 14, 15, 18 and 19. In this case, if the sum of these bits is even, the parity is even and the hamming bit is 0, otherwise the hamming bit is 1. See the full analysis:




Once coded, the resulting 21-bit word can be displayed in hexadecimal form as: 958a9hex. The advantage of this is that, if the reading has a maximum error of 1 bit, this error can be corrected. See for example if the word was read with the value 978a9hex instead. Building the table of bits we will have:




Looking at the parities of the Hamming bits, we see that parity does not check for bits 1, 4, and 8, this represents that there was a read error in bit (1 + 4 + 8) 13 and we promptly correct it.

2512;Reverse Game;Ad-Hoc;9;"Have you heard of reverse game? It's very simple. Given a 3x3 matrix, made up of '*' (asterisks) and '-' (dashes), the player's goal is to change the state of the matrix in order to arrive in a valid state , In which all characters in the array are dashes or all are asterisks. The only rule to make some change in the array is as follows: the player chooses a cell from the array, and then the character corresponding to it and the corresponding cells to its adjacent (left, right, above, and below) Value for the opposite character, that is, if there is any '*' character, it will become '-', and if there is '-', '*'. Below, there is a state change example (red cells are the chosen ones).



The multiplayer version of the game takes place in the following way: a match consists of several rounds. In each round, two matrices of the same initial state (chosen at random) are given, one for each player. Players must then simultaneously change the initial state of their matrix (through the changes described above) to a valid final state. The player freely decides which of these states he should reach. Wins a round the player who meets the above goal in fewer steps. A change in the matrix (the changes of the characters corresponding to the chosen cell and adjacent) corresponds to a step in this game. In this way, the amount of characters changed during some state changes does not interfere with the amount of steps reached. A draw in a round occurs when players get the same amount of steps, no matter what final state they have chosen. The player with the most winning rounds wins a match. There is a draw in a match when players have equal amounts of winning rounds.

2513;Xoringan;Ad-Hoc;10;"Members of Uxorra clan inhabiting the prestigious Leaf Village are prominent ninjas whose skills are envied by many. In addition to its excellent strength and jutsu (ninja techniques) with fire, they have an asset that highlights even more the other ninjas of the village and the world: Their Xoringan.

The Xoringan is a dojutsu (eyes with ninja skills) kekkei genkai (skill transferred through bloodline) very powerful and used by clan members generally in battles. It gives the user a lot of useful skills during a fight, like be able to see the flow of chakra's enemy (used internal energy to do jutsus),predict the movements of the opponent and even copy techniques by looking at them once.

The jutsu are made with a specific combination of seals (gestures with hands joined and positioning of the fingers) where each seal can only be used once in a jutsu. Some seals are more powerful and when used in a jutsu, they give you the power of greater attack, others, not so much. There are 64 different types of seals, being 1 the weakest attack power, the second weakest has twice the first, third weakest has twice the second and so on. This makes each different jutsu to have a single attack power and can be seen by a Xoringan user as a number. For example, a jutsu that uses the first, third and fifth seals has an attack power of 21 and may simply be referred to as jutsu 21.

There are skilled ninjas that can do secret jutsus as they perform other and reuse seals that were used in these jutsus. For example, if the ninja performs a sequence of techniques, he can reuse each combination of seals used to make each jutsus to do the combination of the secret jutsu seals. To find out what is the secret jutsu you need to know which seals, including all used in sequence, remain active. When a seal is made for the first time it is activated, but if is made a second time then it is disabled and can be activated again if it is done again in another jutsu in sequence.

For example, if a ninja do the jutsus 10, 31, 21, 15, 14, 7, 5 and 9 and try to do the secret jutsu using the seals between the third and seventh (21, 15, 14, 7, 5), the secret jutsu that will be done is 22. It is also important to note that not every jutsu is so secret. If in the same sequence he tried to do the secret jutsu only during the first jutsu, it just would eventually make the jutsu 10 again.

Rodrigo is a young Uxorra using his Xoringan to be able to predict all the jutsus that your opponent will do and in the exact order is therefore able to measure the threat that your opponent is. And this is nothing more than the sum of the attack power of all possible secret jutsus that your opponent has the ability to do.

The initial value in the register is 0. Also, FHBZMIPS supports the following operations:


	add n: Adds n units to the register (r ← r + n)
	sub n: Subtract n units from the register (r ← r - n)
	mul n: Multiply its value by n (r ← r × n)
	div n: The register receives the quotient of the division of its value by n (r ← r ∕ n)
	and n: Bit-wise AND with the value n (r ← r AND n)
	or n: Bit-wise OR with the value n (r ← r OR n)

	halt: Finish the program (Halt)


Overflow occurrences, that occur when it is not possible to represent the result of some operation in the register, are treated the same way other processors do, where only the result modulo 256 is kept.

There are two integers associated to each analógimôn: its Combat Power (CP) and its Number of Attacks (NA). Also, there is an integer associated to each gym, its Power Interval (PI).

Hence, player 1 is the first one to leave the line and enter the field. After that, player 2 will leave the line and enter the field, and so on.

When leaving the line, each player salutes every other player that are in front of him in the line with a high five. For example, consider that N=4 and the initial line is 3 1 2 4, where player 4 is the nearest one to the field. Player 1, while going to the field, will salute players 2 and 4 with a high five. Then, player 2 will salute with a high five only the player 4, and will then leave the line. Player 3 also salutes player 4 only (notice that both players 1 and 2 have left the line already).

For this, Roberto will prune branches from the trees that he thinks are ugly. For each branch i of the tree, Roberto defined how beautiful he is by a number wi. Negative values ​​represent that the branch is ugly. The beauty of a Christmas tree is then defined by the sum of the beauties of its branches.

The process of pruning a tree is simple. Roberto cuts a branch from the tree, and all the branches that leave it fall also. In figure 1 we have an example of a tree and a pruning done by Roberto. In each branch of the tree in the figure we have the value wi which describes how beautiful the branch is. In the tree to the right, the branches cut by Roberto are dotted, while the knots and twigs that fell after the cut are dashed. In the example of figure 1, both the blunt and cut tree have a value of beauty.

After reading a few times, the most attentive ones realized that it was an anagram of ""Maratona Mineira"", since Astolfo, the creator of the art, it's a guy that loves anagrams.

An anagram of a word is any other word that is formed by just changing the order of one or more of its letters, for example: ""Alergia"", ""Regalia"" and ""Galeria"" are some of the anagrams of ""Alegria"".

Astolfo wants to make a joke apart with the competitors involving anagrams, to break the ice and to relax the competitors. To do this, he generated a T-text on his computer, and printed it on a giant strip of paper. In this strip, there are important life lessons that competitors should look for.


He would like to lower the strip so that it fits in his suitcase, since it got huge. However, the grace of the strip is precisely that Astolfo hid in the text some anagrams of a deep message M. So when reducing the strip, Astolfo wants that at least one anagram of M on the final strip. He will do the reduction as follows. First, it has chosen an integer b between 1 and T inclusive, and will cut the first b letters of T, discarding the rest. Then he chooses a second integer and between 1 and b inclusive, and will cut the last and letters of the remaining strip, discarding the other letters. This is the final strip of Astolfo.




Astolfo realized that there could be more than one way of performing this procedure so that the resulting strip contained an anagram of M. Thus he chose T and M in such a way as to conceal an important message in that number of forms as well.

In Pokemon Ho, you have pokeballs that catch pokémons (game creatures). Each time a new Pokémon is captured, experience is gained, however repeated pokémons do not. A pokémon master Ho is a player with a lot of experience. And that's why you want to capture as many different types of Pokémon as possible. However, this is not an easy task. The Pokémon, when trying to be captured, can break the Pokeballs. Some more easily than others. In fact, for each pokémon i we have an associated probability pi of the pokémon to break the pokeball. To prevent some Pokémon from being captured, NlogNintendo assumed that pi ≤0.9. That is, at least 10% chance of catching a Pokémon is guaranteed. Furthermore, after each j-th attempt fails, pokemon i has a probability r {i, j} to escape the battle. If the Pokémon escapes, you can not try to capture it again. Since there are many attempts, NLogNintendo only offers Ri chance of escaping for each pokémon i. The probabilities ri, j, 1 ≤j ≤Ri are repeated at each Ri step.

The boys are playing the RPG invented by Dôdo and Leo. The game consists of capturing monsters, training them and using them in battles. At this point, we are entering a map where there are several ""neutral"" locations, labeled 1 to V. In each place, it is possible that there is a coin and / or a lever. Whenever we pass a place with a coin, we collect the coin, and no other coin appears in the same place if we return to it later. Whenever we pass through a location with a lever, we push the lever, and we never have to re-start it. Each lever opens a set of paths that connect pairs of neutral locations. Some paths are already open initially. To cross each path, we must defeat (or capture, if we want to become masters) the monsters that appear on this path. Monsters always appear when crossing any path, so it is always necessary to defeat them, even if they pass through a path that we have crossed before. To defeat a monster, we use the monsters we have already captured. Our monsters have a list of M attacks, each with a mana cost and a damage value that is imposed to the target monster. We are at location 1 and the exit of the map is at location V. Location 1 does not contain a coin or a lever.

2639;Get a Clue!;Ad-Hoc;5;"Developed in the 1940s in the United Kingdom, the game of Cluedo is one of the most popular board games in the world. The object of the game is to determine who murdered Mr. Body, which weapon was used to murder him, and where the murder took place. The game uses a set of cards representing six persons (labeled A, B, . . . , F), six weapons (labeled G, H, . . . , L) and nine rooms (labeled M, N, . . . , U). At the start of the game, one person card, one weapon card, and one room card are selected at random and removed from the deck so no one can see them – they represent the murderer, the murder weapon, and the murder location. The remaining 18 cards are shuffled and dealt to the players, starting with player 1, then to her right player 2, and so on. Some players may end up with one more card than others. For the purposes of this problem there are four players, so the person to the right of player 4 is player 1.

The rest of the game is spent searching for clues. Players take turns, starting with player 1 and moving to the right. A turn consists of making a suggestion (consisting of a murder suspect, a weapon, and a room) and asking other players if they have any evidence that refutes the suggestion. For example, you might say to another player “I believe the murderer was person A, using weapon L, in room T.” If the other player is holding exactly one of these cards, that player must show you (and only you) that card. If they have more than one such card, they can show you any one of them.

When making a suggestion, you must first ask the person to your right for any evidence. If they have none, you continue with the person on their right, and so on, until someone has evidence, or no one has any of the cards in your suggestion.

Many times you can gain information even if you are not the person making the suggestion. Suppose, in the above example, you are the third player and have cards A and T. If someone else shows evidence to the suggester, you know that it must be weapon card L. Keeping track of suggestions and who gave evidence at each turn is an important strategy when playing the game.

To win the game, you must make an accusation, where you state your final guess of the murderer, weapon, and room. After stating your accusation, you check the three cards that were set aside at the start of the game – if they match your accusation, you win! Needless to say, you want to be absolutely sure of your accusation before you make it.

Here is your problem. You are player 1. Given a set of cards dealt to you and a history of suggestions and evidence, you need to decide how close you are to being able to make an accusation.";"The input starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), the number of suggestions made during the game.

Each of these lines starts with three characters representing the suggestion (in the order person, weapon, room), followed by the responses of up to three players, beginning with the player to the right of the player making the suggestion. If a player presents no evidence, a ‘-’ (dash) is listed; otherwise an “evidence character” is listed.

Patrick lost most of his money betting on programming contests, so he needs to pull off another job. For this
he needs your help, even though you have retired from a life of crime. You are reluctant at first, as you have
no desire to return to your old criminal ways, but you figure there is no harm in listening to his plan.

There is a shipment of expensive consumer widgets in a nearby warehouse and Patrick intends to steal as
much of it as he can. This entails finding a way into the building, incapacitating security guards, passing
through various arrays of laser beams – you know, the usual heist techniques. However, the heart of the
warehouse has been equipped with a security system that Patrick cannot disable. This is where he needs
your help.

The shipment is stored in large cubical crates, all of which have the same dimensions. The crates are stacked
in neat piles, forming a three-dimensional grid. The security system takes pictures of the piles once per hour
using three cameras: a front camera, a side camera and a top camera. The image from the front camera
shows the height of the tallest pile in each column, the image from the side camera shows the height of the
tallest pile in each row, and the image from the top camera shows whether or not each pile is empty. If the
security system detects a change in any of the images, it sounds an alarm.

Once Patrick is inside, he will determine the heights of the piles and send them to you. Figure C.1 shows a
possible layout of the grid and the view from each of the cameras.

Patrick wants to steal as many crates as possible. Since he cannot disable the security system, he plans to
fool it by arranging the remaining crates into piles so that the next set of camera images are the same. In
the above example, it is possible to steal nine crates. Figure C.2 shows one possible post-heist configuration

2644;Replicate Replicate Rfplicbte;Ad-Hoc;1;"The owner of the Automatic Cellular Manufacturing corporation has just patented a new process for the mass production of identical parts. Her approach uses a two-dimensional lattice of two-state cells, each of which is either “empty” or “filled.” The exact details are, of course, proprietary.

Initially, a set of cells in the lattice is filled with a copy of the part that is to be reproduced. In a sequence of discrete steps, each cell in the lattice simultaneously updates its state by examining its own state and those of its eight surrounding neighbors. If an odd number of these nine cells are filled, the cell’s state in the next time step will be filled, otherwise it will be empty. Figure G.1 shows several steps in the replication process for a simple pattern consisting of three filled cells.

However, a bug has crept into the process. After each update step, one cell in the lattice might spontaneously flip its state. For instance, Figure G.2 shows what might happen if a cell flipped its state after the first time step and another flipped its state after the third time step.

2646;Secret Chamber at Mount Rushmore;Beginner;6;"By now you have probably heard that there is a spectacular stone sculp- ture featuring four famous U.S. presidents at Mount Rushmore. How- ever, very few people know that this monument contains a secret cham- ber. This sounds like something out of a plot of a Hollywood movie, but the chamber really exists. It can be found behind the head of Abraham Lincoln and was designed to serve as a Hall of Records to store impor- tant historical U.S. documents and artifacts. Historians claim that the construction of the hall was halted in 1939 and the uncompleted cham- ber was left untouched until the late 1990s, but this is not the whole truth.

In 1982, the famous archaeologist S. Dakota Jones secretly visited the monument and found that the chamber actually was completed, but it was kept confidential. This seemed suspicious and after some poking around, she found a hidden vault and some documents inside. Unfortu- nately, these documents did not make any sense and were all gibberish. She suspected that they had been written in a code, but she could not decipher them despite all her efforts.

Earlier this week when she was in the area to follow the ACM-ICPC World Finals, Dr. Jones finally dis- covered the key to deciphering the documents, in Connolly Hall of SDSM&T. She found a document that contains a list of translations of letters. Some letters may have more than one translation, and others may have no translation.

2659;Brincadeira;Ad-Hoc;8;"Um Registrador de Deslocamento é um circuito que desloca de uma posição os elementos de um vetor de bits. O registrador de deslocamento tem uma entrada (um bit) e uma saída (também um bit), e é comandado por um pulso de relógio. Quando o pulso ocorre, o bit de entrada se transforma no bit mais significativo do vetor, o bit menos significativo é jogado na saída do registrador, e todos os outros bits são deslocados de uma posição em direção ao bit menos significativo do vetor (em direção à saída).

Um Registrador de Deslocamento com Retroalimentação Linear (em inglês, LFSR) é um registrador de deslocamento no qual o bit de entrada é determinado pelo valor do ou-exclusivo de alguns dos bits do registrador antes do pulso de relógio. Os bits que são utilizados na retroalimentação do registrador são chamados de torneiras. A figura abaixo mostra um LFSR de 8 bits, com três torneiras (bits 0, 3 e 5).



Durante uma competição de programação, enquanto aguardam a divulgação do resultado final, Ricardo e Cláudio se divertem com um LFSR que encontraram no local.

Eles usam o LFSR para gerar uma sequência infinita de números. Para gerar tal sequência, antes de cada pulso do relógio, os bits do registrador são convertidos para decimal. Assim, para um LFSR como o da figura os primeiros elementos da sequência são: A0 = 169 (10101001), A1 = 212 (11010100), A2 = 106 (01101010), A3 = 53 (00110101) e A4 = 26 (00011010).

2660;Cigarras Periódicas;Mathematics;6;"As “cigarras periódicas” americanas têm o ciclo de vida mais longo de todos os insetos conhecidos. A cada 17 anos, estas cigarras periódicas amadurecem, se acasalam, depositam ovos e morrem.

Um exemplo é a espectrometria de massa de proteínas, uma técnica que permite identificar proteínas de forma bastante eficiente. Podemos representar cada aminoácido por um caractere distinto e uma proteína é representada pela cadeia de caracteres relativos aos amino ácidos que a compõe.

Uma das aplicações da espectrometria de massa de proteínas são buscas em bancos de dados. Para isso a cadeia que representa a proteina é dividida em subcadeias, a massa de cada subcadeia é determinada, e a lista de massas é comparada com um banco de dados de proteínas.

The address itself is a 32-bit address, which here we separates into 4 blocks of 8 bits each for easier reading, the same goes for the address of the mask. Let's write these addresses in binary form:

IP:      11000000.10101000.01001111.01001010
Netmask: 11111111.11111111.11111100.00000000

We can see that the first 22 bits of the netmask are 1s, and the remaining 10 bits are 0s. Many times this address is represented as: 192.168.79.74/22, on account of its 22 bits 1s of the netmask. For this example the exclusive network to which this address belongs is defined by the first 22 bits of the addressing, all the machines belonging to this network have in their first 22 bits the same values. Each machine belonging to the network will use each of the 10 final bits to define a unique address for itself.

This parallel association is equivalent to a resistor of 10 Ω. We can also consider series associations, as the example below, which results in an equivalent resistance of 40Ω.

                

Finally, a hybrid association, with series and parallel. The association below results in 50Ω.

                

To better represent an association we will consider the equivalent resistance Req of a series association between resistors R1 and R2 represented as: Req = R1 - R2. Similarly for the parallel association: Req = R1 | R2. There is no precedence between associations, except when explicitly expressed in parentheses, for example: R1 - R2 | R3 is equivalent to (R1-R2) | R3, and R1 | R2 - R3 is equivalent to (R1 | R2 - R3) These two circuits can be drawn, respectively, as:

                

In this way a hybrid association is represented by an expression that follows the following rule, considering R the nominal value of a resistance in Ohms (Ω):

2688;Choosing a Place;Graph;10;"Meals in the cafeteria of the Federal Institute of South Minas (IF), Muzambinho campus, are delicious. Every day students eagerly await to taste their delights. Webscrit Junior (WBJ) is always one of the last on the queue and always finds the place almost full, with only a few free seats. As WBJ is very observant, he walks through the halls looking for places to sit. One place he can sit is an available chair where the average height of adjacent persons in that seat is less than the size of WBJ and always as close to the exit (which is in row 1 column 8, indicated in the figure by number 77, just for easy viewing). All this care to then run in the free spaces, and not lose any second of your favorite subject (AED).

Below is an example of the empty cafeteria:



Attention:
- The priority chair is that one that has the adjacent average less than the height and the smallest way to the exit;
- There are no seats available on the walls (88), in the spaces outside the cafeteria (11) or in the last places of the table (on the corners); you do not have a good view of the cafeteria sitting closer to the window;
- Each chair that WEJ passes is considered 1 step;
- There will be no tie, always have a chair that meets the requirements;
- The ""00"" of the figure shows where are chairs, ONLY for easier viewing.
- The exit of the cafeteria is fixed [Line 1 | Column 8] and will always be in this position. In the picture, this position is represented by number 77 only to promote a better visualization.
- As the output is always fixed, the size of the cafeteria (13x13) is also fixed;
- The adjacent ones of the chair are all the chairs that are around;
- The exit (1,8) will always be a wall;

Taking the entry below as an example we have:
- Chair 1 with position (L = 3 | C = 3);
- Chair 2 with position (L = 6 | C = 6);
- Chair 3 with position (L = 8 | C = 12);
* The count starts from one.

Suppose that chair 1 and 2, located above (as base) meets the criteria of the average of its adjacent. We can conclude that chair 1 is closer to the exit than chair 2, because the number of chairs WBJ will pass to the exit, is smaller. And it is closer than chair 3 (L = 8 | C = 12) which is not only on the table top (a considerable place) but far from the exit.

2689;Game of the Miao;Ad-Hoc;3;"A long time happens the secret game of miao. Most people say that the game is annoying and very difficult because no one managed to win the famous prize, but even so Webscript Junior (WBJ) decided to try. The game works as follows: a scarecrow shows a picture with suitcases, where there will only be one suitcase with the miao. Not even the scarecrow remembers in which briefcase he kept it and WBJ only has an opportunity to take this ""MIAO!"" home. WBJ picked up the contents of the suitcases that were already chosen by other players to see if there was any pattern.

After many research, WBJ concluded that the award-winning case was in an i-th position of a sequence, so he introduced the game to some friends to see how the game and the scarecrow behaved with each move and thereby gain more information for his research. The most relevant information is that, in addition to luck, the suitcases where the subtraction of the indexes is different from the difference that most repeats, serves as a standard to define which are the possible prize-winning suitcases.

For more accurate information, WBJ asked for his help. He wants a program that generates a list of suitcases where possibly would be the prize. He gives you 9 suitcases on a grid (3x3). Your program generates the list and he just had to hit the number of the suitcase, within the possible suitcases that he would have as a reference generated by your program.

For example:
Let's assume that the suitcases that WBJ chose were:
78 7 8
9 7 8
8 7 9

The difference is calculated as follows: the first element is calculated with the next, and the other two with its previous one ignoring the signal, thus the difference between the suitcases looks like this:

71 71 1
2 2 1
1 1 2

The first number is a result of 78 minus 7, the second is 7 minus 78, and the third is 8 less. The process repeats itself in the other lines. Then we conclude that the difference that repeats the most is the number 1, the next step is to verify if the difference between the numbers is not the one that repeats the most. The difference for the first number is calculated with the second and third, the difference of the second number is calculated with the first and last, so the difference of the last with the previous two. If the result of these differences is 1, the number is not displayed, for example: the second number less the third of the cases that WBJ gave you is 1, then the second number is not valid and the same is the case with the third. The end result looks like this:

Each color is encoded by an integer, and initially all cells have the same color. The instructions that you found represent N steps to be performed before the device shows the way to the treasure.

Perhaps by some kind of premonition, before his fatal excursion he wrote in a letter to one of his nieces in the Netherlands the exact distance to his hidden treasure, from Pico Colombo in the south direction.

Wary that the map would end up in the wrong hands, Cheesehead used his math skills as an insurance against robbers. Instead of writing in the letter the number indicating the distance, he multiplied it by a second number N, and wrote the result D in the letter, together with the value of N and an explanation of the computation he had done. He knew that even if some unwanted person had the letter, he or she would have to know how to divide two numbers, which very few robbers could at that time. Unfortunately, when the letter arrived in Europe, Cheesehead’s niece had joined a convent to become a nun and did not even bother to open the letter.

2700;Fundraising;Beginner;9;"A prestigious politician aiming for presidency next year is planning a fundraising dinner for her cam- paign. She has a list of some wealthy people in the country and wants to invite them in a way that the amount of money raised is as great as possible.

Sometimes wealthy people have futile behavior and don’t like the idea that someone richer or prettier than them exists. Every time someone like this meets another person who is strictly prettier, but not strictly richer, then an argument ensues. Likewise, if they meet another person who is strictly richer, but not strictly prettier, an argument occurs as well. These two situations are the only possible causes of an argument involving two persons. Thus, two persons do not have an argument if one of them is strictly prettier and strictly richer than the other. Also, two persons do not have an argument if they are equally rich and equally pretty.

Since the presidential candidate wants to raise as much money as possible, an argument should be avoided at all costs, as it could ruin the campaign.

2701;Gates of Uncertainty;Ad-Hoc;8;"A NAND gate (negative-AND gate) is a digital electronic circuit which produces an output that is false only if all its inputs are true; in other words, the output of a NAND gate is the complement to the output of an AND gate for the same inputs. A two-input NAND gate is a NAND gate with two inputs. The following figure shows the usual symbol of a two-input NAND gate and its truth table, using 1 for true and 0 for false.



In this problem we have a binary tree representing a circuit composed only by two-input NAND gates. In the tree, each internal node represents a NAND gate, which uses as inputs the values produced by its two children. Each leaf in the tree represents an external input to the circuit, and is a value in {0,1}. The value produced by the circuit is the value produced by the gate at the root of the tree. The following picture shows a circuit with nine nodes, of which four are NAND gates and five are external inputs.



Each gate in the circuit may be stuck , meaning that it either only produce 0 or only produce 1, regardless of the gate’s inputs. A test pattern is an assignment of values to the external inputs so that the value produced by the circuit is incorrect, due to the stuck gates.

The flight attendant in this flight decided to change the procedure. First she will ask all passengers what choice of meal they would prefer, and then she will check if the number of meals available in this flight for each choice are enough.

As an example, consider that the available number of meals for chicken, beef and pasta are respectively (80, 20, 40), while the number of passenger’s choices for chicken, beef and pasta are respectively (45, 23, 48). In this case, eleven people will surely not receive their selection for a meal, since three passengers who wanted beef and eight passengers who wanted pasta cannot be pleased.

The new emperor of Cubiconia has just raised the taxes (again!), but promised to repair at least some of the roads, guaranteeing that Cubiconians will be able to travel between any pair of cities using only restored roads.

The Department of Public Works have calculated the cost of repairing each individual road. Now they want to calculate the minimum cost for repairing a set of roads so that the emperor’s promise is made true. This is not easy because the emperor wants the set of repaired roads to include one particular road, but he has not yet decided which particular road to include: could be the one that connects the city where his castle is to the city where his daughter’s royal residence is, or the road that connects the city where his summer palace is to the only city by the seaside, or. . .

2704;Jumping Frog;Ad-Hoc;8;"Pog the Frog wants to compete in the World Frog Jump competition, which will take place in Nlogonia. In the competition, each frog must perform a sequence of acrobatic jumps in a specially built arena. The arena is composed of N equally spaced positions around a circumference (the arc between two adjacent positions is always the same length) where each position can be either a rock or a pond. The positions are numbered sequentially from 0 to N − 1 in the clockwise direction, so that judges can easily make notes about which jumps were performed in each position. Thus, position 0 is adjacent to positions 1 and N − 1 in the arena.

The competition rules stipulate that the sequence of jumps of each frog must start at a rock, always go from a rock to another rock, and finish at the same position it started. The rules do not require frogs to use every rock in the arena for their sequence of jumps.

Pog the Frog is currently practicing for the competition. He must develop two skills. First, he needs to get better at jumping from one rock to another, since landing on either a pond or outside of the marked positions can mean disqualification. Besides that, he must learn impressing acrobatic moves. With that in mind, he has decided on a practicing strategy. In the beginning of each practice session, Pog the Frog will pick a starting rock and an integer jump length K between 1 and N − 1. After that, whenever he is standing on a rock numbered i, he will aim his next acrobatic jump at the rock whose number is obtained by getting the remainder of the division of i + K by N. He will stop when he lands on the starting rock. For example, if the arena has 3 positions, all of them rocks, and Pog the Frog starts at position 0 and picks K = 2, he will first jump from rock 0 to rock 2, then to rock 1, and finally jump back to rock 0. At this point, his practice session ends.

2792;Golnaldinho;Ad-Hoc;8;"Golnaldinho was a brilliant football player, having marked passages in all the teams in which he acted during his career, whether national as Grêmio, Flamengo and Atlético-MG, or international, such as Milan, PSG and Barcelona. His genius with the ball in his foot earned him several calls to represent the Brazilian National Team, as well as a legion of fans around the world. This year, in search of new challenges, Golnaldinho decided to retire the boots and venture into the world of computing.


This news surprised several people who did not know the love of Golnaldinho by algorithms and data structures. Such love made the former player spend hours studying the subject while concentrating on football matches. During a press conference at which he announced his retirement, he himself stated that as he improved his programming skills, he was better at field performance.


During his studies, Golnaldinho found a book of computational problems and he was intrigued by a specific problem, because he could not solve it. Competitive as he is and knowing his programming skills, Golnaldinho challenged him to solve it.


The statement of such a problem is as follows:

Suppose an array with \(\displaystyle{N}\) integers, where the i-th position of this array is occupied by the value \(\displaystyle{i}\)hat is, position 1 is occupied by value 1, position 2 is occupied by value 2 and so on, as can be visualized in the figure below:



Kaka would like to remove all the numbers from this array. However, exclusions to be made must follow a specific order. Thinking about this, Kaká implemented a function that deletes a single element at a time, given the index of the element to be excluded. That is, if Kaka wants to delete element 2 in the array above, it would suffice to inform the index of the element, which in this case is equal to 2. As a result, the function would return the following array after performing the deletion:



Now, if Kaká wanted to delete element 4 from the array, it would suffice to inform the index that in this case is equal to 3. The function would return:



This procedure is performed until there is no more element in the array.
Kaka is having trouble automating calls to this function. This is because you could not implement a script that provides the order of indexes to be excluded, respecting the order of deletion of the elements. That is, if for an array with \(\displaystyle{N=5}\) the order of deletion of the elements is {2,4,5,1,3}, the order of the indices will be {2,3,3,1,1}. Could you help with this implementation?";"The entry begins with a line containing an integer \(N\), indicating the number of elements in the array.

An Affine cipher consists in suppose some symbols of a T size alphabet as numbers of an interval [0..T-1]. Two positive numbers A and B are chosen. To cipher a symbol is necessary to multiply its position value on the alphabet by A and the number B needs to be added to the result of this multiplication. In the end, the result will be the position of the symbol that will replace the original in the sequence. If this new position does not correspond to a valid position inside the size of the alphabet, it supposes that the alphabet will be repeated many times on the right, in the way to have all estimated positions.

For example, suppose an alphabet which its size is 7 and A=4 and B=2. To cipher any symbol from this alphabet is necessary to extend the alphabet to the right by 3 times, as shown below:

2811;Sibi-Xor;Paradigms;9;"Dabriel went to visit his friend Farcos in his hometown, Manaus, in the state of Amazonas. When he got there, Dabriel was surprised at the way people spoke because of the very specific regional expressions they used. One curious expression he heard from a Farcos talk with his other friend RapBoy was ""Sibicho"", which is a reduction of the phrase ""Look at that bug, O"". A well-used regionalism to show disdain for what one hears or doubts one's assertion

The first time he heard the expression Dabriel thought it was the bitwise operation on numbers called Sibi-Xor that he had learned recently at the university and explained to Farcos. Farcos, in turn, was very happy to discover the operation because, in addition to enjoying bitwise operations, he found a way to make Rapboy stop using that expression with him in a tone of disdain. Now every time Rapboy said ""Sibicho"" he would have to tell Farcos the Sibi-Xor Result from a list of Numbers provided by him.

The Sibi-Xor operation on a list of numbers consists of 3 steps:

1)Make the AND-bitwise of all subsequences in the list. We will call each result subset-and.

2)Do the XOR-bitwise of all subset-and's that were formed with the same amount of elements.

3)Add up all the results from step 2.

				Alan selects a number of cards that are in a stack and distributes them sequentially to his friends, from first to last. He can see the value of each card and must ensure that the division is as balanced as possible between all players, considering just the sum of the value of their cards. To make it clear, if for example Alan had 4 cards (3, 6, 2 and 10) to distribute between two players, he would have to give cards 3, 6 and 2 to the first player (sum = 11) and the card 10 to the second player. The division 9 and 12 would be discard because the first rule of the game is that the maximum sum must be as small as possible (11 is less than 12). 

				There is a second rule that must be respected in this game: once the maximum sum value is established, each player, starting with the first one, should try to keep a sum as close as possible to this value. This can be seen in the first test case (below).

The second player would have the next two cards (6 and J) that would sum 17 and the last player would have four cards (K, 10, 4 and A) that would result in 28. The division 22, 22 and 28 wont be accetable because the first player could still take the value card 5 to get 27 (less than limit 28 in this case). Nor could divide into 21, 30, and 15, because we would be surpassing the smallest possible maximum value (which is 28). So we have that the maximum of cards for one of the players would be 6 and the maximum value obtained from the sum of these cards would be 28, which is the answer for the first test case presented below.

	The player must enter a array M such that | M | = | V | and the game says whether he hit or not.


For example the array V = [1, 4, 7, 5], for a1 = 1 the answer will be 4 which is in position a2, since a2 > a1 and the index 2 > 1 and a2 is closest to a1, a2 = 4 the answer will be 7 which is in the position a3, since a3 > a2 and the index 3 > 2, already for a3 = 7 the answer will be “*” since there is no aj (j > 3 and j ≤ | V | which satisfies the conditions of the game, the same happens for a4 = 5.

His last invention was the VDH (Honesty Virus) which, when in contact with a human, would make him an honest person forever (it would even work with politicians!).

After a few months wandering from country to country, she got a fixed home in China. One fine day, while taking photos at the Wall of China, she had an idea of how to spread the VDH in Brazil. Her idea was to spread some invisible robots (yes, she invented invisible robots) in the cities of Brazil and these robots would launch the VDH gradually (so it would not call so much attention) until all of Brazil was infected.

We will see Brazil as a NxM grid, where in some cells of this grid there will be a robot equipped with the VDH.

A robot is able to launch the virus to the four directions (North, South, East and West) and initially has a release power of 1. This means that on the first day it will infect 1 cell in each direction. With each new day its power increases by one unit, causing the robot on the third day, for example, to infect up to 12 cells, 3 in each direction.

2897;Command History;Ad-Hoc;8;"A command-line interface (CLI) is one of the oldest human-computer interface types in existence. A CLI allows interaction with the software through a command interpreter and is usually accessible in a text terminal (or window). The advantage of a command interpreter is that it allows the user to operate the system using only the keyboard. Even today, where we are accustomed to sophisticated graphical interfaces, many applications and operating systems include some kind of command-line interface, and many users still prefer to use it for most tasks. One of the most useful features of a command interpreter is the command history. When a command is entered and executed, it is placed in the command history of the terminal.
				The command can be displayed again in the terminal by pressing the '↑' key; the Enter key executes the command again when the command is being displayed on the terminal. All the commands executed are stored in the history: pressing the '↑' key twice shows the penultimate command executed, pressing it three times displays the third-last command, and so on. For example, if the initial history is (A, B, C, D), to repeat the C command simply press the '↑' key twice. The history will then be updated to (A, B, C, D, C). At this point, to repeat command A, it is necessary to press the '↑' key five times; the history will be updated to (A, B, C, D, C, A). At this point, to repeat command A once more, press the '↑' key once; the history will be updated to (A, B, C, D, C, A, A).

There is one concentrator in each capital, and one branch of fiber optic connects directly to a pair of hubs. Not every hub is connected directly by one branch of fiber to all other hubs, but the network is connected. That is, from a given concentrator there is a sequence of branches and concentrators that allows information generated in any of the concentrators can be sent to any other hub in the network. For data communication, it is normal for a fiber optic branch to be used to send messages in both directions. The developed technology, however, has a peculiarity: after a branch of optical fiber is used to transport matter in one direction, the optical fiber keeps a memory of that fact, and from then on this branch can only be used to transport matter in that direction. Hubs are not affected by this steering memory. SBC's research group is very good in physics, but very weak in computing.

But before he could begin to explore the area an accident disrupted his plans: his suitcase sprang open and his collection of fantastic beasts escaped from the magical object.

The inhabitants of Nlogonia love zoos, and so there are many of them in the kingdom. It turns out that the beasts share Nlogonians’ passion for zoos and since the accident they have been visiting the various zoos.

Beasts breaking free and causing trouble is nothing new for Newt so he had trackers put on the beasts since the previous incident. Thus, at any moment he knows the exact position of each of the beasts. After watching the beasts movements for some time he noticed that they follow a peculiar pattern: if a beast is currently in a given zoo, after a unit of time it will either stay in that zoo or it will move to another zoo that depends on the current zoo. All beasts that move to another zoo do this instantly and simultaneously.

With this information Newt conjectured that perhaps it’s not so diﬃcult to recover the creatures. He believes that eventually all of them may meet in the same zoo at the same time so he only needs to wait at the right place and capture all the fantastic beasts at once.

Red-black trees are special, because the same tree gives two diﬀerent kinds of fruit: the red fruit and the black fruit. That gives Farmer Fred a problem: how to rank children who collected the same amounts of diﬀerent fruits? For instance, if Abby picked two red and three black fruits, and Bruce picked three red and two black fruits, who should rank higher in the competition? How much should each fruit be worth?

To solve this problem, Farmer Fred decided that each red fruit would be worth r points, and each black fruit would be worth b points, both r and b positive integers. Then he would rank the kids according to the total number of points each one has, ties broken arbitrarily.

All that’s left to do now is choose the values of r and b.

2912;Jeopardized Election;Ad-Hoc;10;"Nlogonian elections are coming up soon and there are many candidates running for President of one of the greatest nations on Earth.

The voting system used in Nlogonia is quite out of the ordinary. Each person votes by making a list of all candidates, in order of preferences of the voter. This means that the first candidate in the list is the one whose proposals please the voter most, and the last candidate in the list is the one whose proposals please the voter least.

Suppose that there are exactly five voters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, exactly five candidates A, B, C, D and E, and the voters voted as shown in the following table:



To determine the winner, the Electoral Commission first makes a draw, called Election Ordering, which contains all the candidates in a certain order. Then each candidate is evaluated following the Election Ordering, until one of them is elected as President. For this to happen, the current evaluated candidate must be the preferred still-running candidate for more than half of the voters.

To make the election system clearer, continuing the example above, suppose that the result of the Election Ordering is C, D, A, E and B. To determine the winner the Electoral Commission would perform the following steps:

• The first candidate evaluated is C. As this candidate is the preferred candidate for just two of the five voters (1 and 3), then C is eliminated.

• Next candidate evaluated is D, who is the preferred still-running candidate for only two voters (1 and 5). Thus, candidate D is also eliminated.

• Candidate A is evaluated next. Since this candidate is the preferred still-running candidate for three of the five voters (1, 4 and 5), candidate A is elected as President and the voting ends.

One of the candidates has managed to corrupt some members of the Electoral Commission, and can now decide what the result of the Election Ordering will be. Also, thanks to various social networks analysis, the candidate knows the list that each voter will vote.

According to legend, an Indian tapuia from the Amazon region got pregnant by a boto.

Twins were born (a boy and a girl), who were actually snakes. The girl was named Maria Caninana, and the boy was baptized Norato. 


The twins were left on the Tocantins River and grown up alone.


Snake Norato was good, he saved who was drowning and helped the boatmen and fishermen in danger. Caninana was the opposite: she attacked people.


Norato used to visit his mother and attend the city dances, because he loved to dance. In these days he would come out of the water, leave the huge snake skin on the bank, and turn into a man. Late in the evening, he would put on snake skin and return to the river.


Norato wanted to be disenchanted, to become a real man and he gave the recipe to break the enchant to several friends, but none of them had the courage to go to the end. Finally, a soldier was able to disenchant him.


The legend ends by telling that Cobra Norato's skin was burned and that the Honorato boy lived for many years in Pará, where he was loved by all.


What the legend doesn't tell is that the soldier and his battalion companions had to do a huge job to divide the snake's huge skin leather into parts and take it to another place where it would not cause a fire in the Wood.


The length of the leather was divided into varied pieces. The sizes of the pieces were according to the fixed length that each soldier carried in a trip to the fire.


In addition, the battalion was such that a stronger soldier could always take, in a single trip, exactly multiple times the size that a weaker soldier could, but no fraction more or less. And there was a soldier who always carried pieces of size one.

We will not go into the details of the rules of the game, firstly because everyone should know, given the niche of this test; secondly that for this problem, we are not interested in the rules, but in the scoring system.

The game is done in rounds, and the team that reaches or exceeds X points wins (archaically they were 12 or 15 points, but over time they have made the trick a more dynamic experience). In each round, a team can win 1 or a multiple amount of 3 in points (the famous shouting).

2956;13 Variables Derivative;Mathematics;1;"The derivative of a function y = f (x) at a point x = x0, is equal to the value of the trigonometric tangent of the angle formed by the geometric tangent to the representative curve of y = f (x), at the point x = x0, the derivative is the angular coefficient of the line tangent to the graph of the function at point x0. The derivative of a function y = f (x) can also be represented by the symbols: y ', dy / dx or f' (x). The derivative of a function f (x) at point x0 is given by:

				

				In classical geometry, the line tangent to the graph of the function f in a was the only line that passed through the point (a, f (a)) that did not find the graph of f across, meaning that the line did not pass directly through the graph. The slope of the secant to the graph of f in the image above, which passes through the points (x, f (x)) and (x + h, f (x + h)) is given by the quotient of Newton:

				

				An alternative definition is: The function f is differentiable in a if there exists a function φa of I in continuous R in a such that:

				

				For example, if we consider the function f of R in R defined by f (x) = x² + x - 1, it is differentiable in 0. It is possible to observe in the image below the graphs of the constraints of that function at intervals [-1 , (1) and [-1 / 10,1 / 10] and it is clear that while the former is rather curved (and hence f (x) - f (0) is far from linear) is practically indistinguishable from a line segment (from slope 1). In fact, the more the graph is enlarged near (0, f (0)), the closer it is to being linear.

				

				When we derive the derivative of a function, the result is also a function of x and as such can also be differentiated. Calculating the derivative again yields the second derivative of the function f. Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative is called the third derivative, and so on. We can refer to the subsequent derivatives of f by:

				

				If f is a function with real values ​​in R, then the partial derivative of f measures its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes. For example, if f is a function of x and y, then its partial derivative measures the change in f in the x-direction and y-direction. However, they (partial derivatives) do not directly measure the variation of f in any other direction, such as that along the diagonal line y = x.
