They draw a NxM grid on the ground, initially empty, and the ultimate goal is to master as much of this grid as possible.\n\nThe students play alternately, always following the same order: Red, Hot, Chili and Peppers. After Peppers, the turn returns to Red and so they continue playing until they complete K rounds. In each of the rounds, the player can choose between two possible moves:\n\nL X -> {} It means to dominate the line X of the grid, writing the initial of its name in all the elements contained in this line.\n\nC Y -> {} It means to dominate the column Y of the grid, writing the initial of its name in all elements contained in that column.","id":"2570","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":476,"solved":149,"ratio":"31.30%"}}
