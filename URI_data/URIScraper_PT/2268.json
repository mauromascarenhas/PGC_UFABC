{"output":"Display the weight range (in kilograms) that can be attached to the crane without the crane toppling over. If the range is [a, b], display [a] .. [b]. For example, if the range is [1.5, 13.3], display 1 .. 14. If the range is [a, ∞), display [a] .. inf. If the crane cannot carry any weight, display unstable instead.","input":"The input consists of a single test case. The test case starts with a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100), the number of points of the polygon used to describe the crane\u2019s shape. The following n pairs of integers xi , yi (−2 000 ≤ xi ≤ 2 000, 0 ≤ yi ≤ 2 000) are the coordinates of the polygon points in order. The weight is attached at the first polygon point and at least two polygon points are lying on the x-axis.","level":1,"name":"Crane Balancing","has_images":true,"description":"Wherever there is large-scale construction, you will find cranes that do the lifting. One hardly ever thinks about what marvelous examples of engineering cranes are: a structure of (relatively) little weight that can lift much heavier loads. But even the best-built cranes may have a limit on how much weight they can lift.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Association of Crane Manufacturers (ACM) needs a program to compute the range of weights that a crane can lift. Since cranes are symmetric, ACM engineers have decided to consider only a cross section of each crane, which can be viewed as a polygon resting on the x-axis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure C.1: Crane cross section\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFigure C.1 shows a cross section of the crane in the first sample input. Assume that every 1 × 1 unit of crane cross section weighs 1 kilogram and that the weight to be lifted will be attached at one of the polygon vertices (indicated by the arrow in Figure C.1). Write a program that determines the weight range for which the crane will not topple to the left or to the right.","id":"2268","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":12,"solved":5,"ratio":"41.67%"}}
