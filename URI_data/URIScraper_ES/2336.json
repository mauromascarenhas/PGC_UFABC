{"output":"Output will consist in a line for each test case containing the value of the string given in decimal modulus 109 + 7.","input":"Input consistis of a string as said in the description and ends with EOF.","level":5,"name":"ABC","has_images":false,"description":"In the branch of mathematics and computing there are numerous ways to represent a number, these forms we call base, which can be represented several ways each with its own utilities and peculiarities, for example, decimal base commonly used in mathematics or binary represented only by 0's and 1's and even hexadecimal numbers consisting of 0 to 9 with the characters A, B, C, D, E and F.\n\nSome people are passionate about binary, others prefer sameness and continue in decimal base and some people prefer the ABC. ABC consists of a base formed by the characters of the alphabet in capital letters, ie A, B, C, ..., X, Y, Z where A's value is 0, B's value 1 util Z's value which is 25. With this in mind your task is, given a string S, 0 < |S| ≤10³, which belongs to the ABC base, convert it to a decimal base, but remember, the value represented by S may be too large then your result should be module 109+7.","id":"2336","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":531,"solved":307,"ratio":"57.82%"}}
