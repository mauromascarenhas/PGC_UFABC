Your friend David, who does'nt feel happy with his Computer Science course - result of his poor programming skills, dream to join one of the public security forces and, when he was studying about those simulations, he found the following problem:\n\n\"In a given situation, the tatical defense team must find an alarm clock - which simulates a bomb - which will have a screen showing two numbers A and B. To disarm the bomb, the team need to write the Gratest Common Divisor of all numbers from A to B.\"\n\nNobody knows why someone would simulate a bomb which such requisit, but, David is curious to know which should be the correct numbers to stop the bomb. As you know, he's not good with those 'programming or math stuff' so, he asks your help to find out the answer to the following problem:\n\n\"Given two integers A and B, print the greates common divisor of all integers in the interval [A, A+1, A+2, ...
