{"output":"For each instance, print the minimum amount of minutes that Julyane takes to visit all locations, using no more than K teleporters. If you can not visit all places, print -1.","input":"The input contains several instances. The first line of input contains an integer T indicating the number of instances. The first line in each instance contains three integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 15), M (1 ≤ M ≤ N2) and K (0 ≤ K ≤ 5) representing respectively the number of locations, number of routes and the amount maximum allowable of teleporters. Then, follows M lines, each line containing three integers A, B and C (1 ≤ C ≤ 30000), representing respectively that the location A is connected with the location B by a route, and Fulyane takes C minutes to get from A to B using this route.","level":10,"name":"Penalization","has_images":false,"description":"In the game Pomekon, one of the goals is to visit real places to get new items and experience.
