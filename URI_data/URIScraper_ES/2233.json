{"output":"Print a line in the output containing a positive integer, in hexadecimal with lowercase letters, representing the maximum number of labels that can stick to the wall.","input":"The input consists of three lines respectively containing the entire R, G and B, 1 ≤ R, G, B ≤ ffffff. All three integers at the entrance are in hexadecimal, with lowercase letters.","level":3,"name":"Colorful Labels","has_images":true,"description":"We have a red square label entire side R, an unlimited amount of green stickers the entire side G and an unlimited amount of blue stickers whole square side B. We can always paste the red sticker on the wall. A green label only can be pasted on the wall of the red label and have to be fully on it. A blue label can be pasted on the wall of a single green label and have to be fully on it. There can be no overlap of the same color label and the bases of all the labels have to be horizontal. In the figure, we paste 14 stickers on the wall. In this problem, your program must compute the maximum number of labels that can stick to the wall. Only one detail: the entire R, G, and B will be given in hexadecimal and the response must also be in hexadecimal.","id":"2233","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":659,"solved":391,"ratio":"59.33%"}}
