Instead of the traditional 28 pieces, numbered from 0 to 6 at their ends, there were no repeated pieces, his had 55 pieces, numbered from 0 to 9 at their ends, and there were no repeated pieces. One day, Caco loaned his Domino to Chagas, and the same Would return, after a while, with missing parts. Before returning, Chagas wanted to analyze how much the Domino was still playable, even missing pieces. Given the remaining pieces, he wanted to see which sequence of pieces he could put on the table.\r\n\r\nFor example: If he had only four pieces remaining, and these pieces were 1-2, 2-2, 2-3, 4-4, as pictured below, the largest possible sequence would consist of three pieces:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWrite a program that, given the remaining parts of the domino, reports the size of the largest possible sequence among them.","id":"2585","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":122,"solved":47,"ratio":"38.52%"}}
