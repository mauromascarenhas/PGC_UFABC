{"output":"For each instance print an integer that represents the maximum distance she will walk without passing by any PokeStop.","input":"The input consists of many instances of the problem. The first line contains just an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 20) that represents the number of instances.\n\t\t\t\t\tFor each instance is given a line with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5) respectly the length of the road and the number of PokeStops in the road.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the next line there will be m integers representing the distance of the PokeStops from Rahayane's position. The distance of a PokeStop form Rhayane initial's position is always less of equal to 10^6.","level":7,"name":"Passing By The PokeStops","has_images":false,"description":"Rhayane loves math and of course she also loves pokémons. She belives that her mathematical knowledge will help in her jorney as a pokémon trainer. Right now she is at a long road (straight line) with many PokeStops in the way, Rhayane wants to know the maximum distance she will walk without passing by any PokeStop and of course she asked your help for this task.\n\nGiven the length of the road in meters and the PokeStop's distances, also in meters, from Rhayane's initial position (beginning of the road, where there is no PokeStop) make a program that determines such a distance. Per instance, if the distances are: {2, 4, 5, 1} and the length of the road is 7, then the biggest distance she will walk without passing by any PokeStop is 2 meters (between 2 and 4, or 5 and 7).","id":"2219","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":431,"solved":128,"ratio":"29.70%"}}
