Curiously, each single person answered that was in love with exactly one other person, but was shy about declaring these feelings. With this information, ACM wants to form marriages, so people can live happier. If a person A1 is in love with a person A2 and the person A2 is also in love with the person A1, of course ACM can form the marriage {A1, A2}. However, if A1 is in love with A2, but A2 is in love with A3, who is in love with A4\u2026 who is in love with Ak, wherein Ak in love with A1, it is also possible to form the marriage {A1, A2, \u2026, Ak}, since recently the polygamic marriage has been approved in Brazil. More formally, ACM can form the marriage {A1, \u2026, Ak} if and only if k ≥ 2, the person Ak is in love with the person A1 and, for every i ∈ {2, \u2026, k}, the person Ai - 1 is in love with the person Ai.\n\nHelp ACM to form the largest number of marriages as possible.","id":"1902","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":644,"solved":263,"ratio":"40.84%"}}
