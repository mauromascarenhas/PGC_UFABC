Even as GPS systems today are based on social networks, making it fun (and perhaps more difficult to understand, but that's another conversation). Being popular on Facebook is almost a necessity. A person with less than 700, 800 friends can be considered almost as a pariah in this new reality.\n\nMaybe that's why some people tend to exaggerate when they say the number of friends they have. Consider a community of N individuals, and for each one, consider that we know the number of friends that everyone claims to have in the community. Your task in this problem is to determine if indeed it is possible that all community members are speaking the truth. Remember that a person can not be a friend to herself, and the two people can't be friends several times.","id":"1462","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":1528,"solved":323,"ratio":"21.14%"}}
