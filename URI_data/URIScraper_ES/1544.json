{"output":"For each line of the input file you should output a single digit, which is the last non-zero digit of NPM. For example, if NPM is 720 then the last non-zero digit is 2. So in this case your output should be 2.","input":"The input file contains several lines of input. Each line of the input file contains two integers N (0 ≤ N ≤ 20000000), M (0 ≤ N). Input is terminated by end-of-file.","level":8,"name":"The Last Non-zero Digit","has_images":false,"description":"In this problem it will be given to you two decimal integer numbers N, M. You will have to find the last non-zero digit of the NPM. This means no of permutations of N things taking M at a time.","id":"1544","category":"Matemáticas","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":1274,"solved":372,"ratio":"29.20%"}}
