{"output":"Output a line with one integer representing the size of the largest set of metals satisfying the requirements specified in the problem statement.","input":"The first line contains four integers N, M, A and B, representing respectively how many different pieces of metal exist (1 ≤ N ≤ 105), how many compatibilities there are (1 ≤ M ≤ 105) and the variables A and B described in the problem statement (0 ≤ A,B < N). The different metals are conveniently numbered from 1 to N. Each of the following M lines contains two integers X and Y corresponding to a pair of compatible metals (1 ≤ X, Y ≤ N with X ≠Y). There are no repeated pairs in the input.","level":8,"name":"Back to the Future","has_images":false,"description":"Doctor Emmet is working on a safer device to travel in time. He gathered N different and rare pieces of metal. Each piece may be compatible with some other different pieces. He has a complete list with M distinct pairs of compatible metals. Any pair of metals that is not on the list is incompatible.\r\n\r\nIn order for the device to work, he must choose a set of metals such that each of them is compatible with at least A others in that set. However, in order to preserve some balance, they must also be incompatible with at least B others in that set.\r\n\r\nMore metals mean more energy and a safer device. This is why Doctor Emmet needs your help, he wants to know the size of the largest set he can choose that meets these criteria.","id":"2346","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":534,"solved":137,"ratio":"25.66%"}}
