Knowing it, she is making a list with her christmas wishes. However, Jucilena is an undecided girl (and her wishes are many), what makes Nicolau confused from what present she really wants. On their lists, cast the name of the desired gift, its value (this field prompted by her mother) and the preference of the same in a scale, from the least preferred (1) to the most desired (10). Seeing this idea, Jucilena's friends also do the same, because all have various gift options.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll this messing lists and gifts left, Santa Claus is crazy! Seeing this, the Christmas spirit has touched you and you decided to help Santa, creating a program that shows the list of the most desired gifts for Jucilena and his friends. Gifts should be shown in descending order of preference. If the preference of one another is the same, it should be shown the lowest value first. If there is similarity between preference and value, they should be listed in alphabetical order.","id":"2022","category":"Estructuras de Datos y Bibliotecas","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":1208,"solved":354,"ratio":"29.30%"}}
