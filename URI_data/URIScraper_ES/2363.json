Each test case has three integers N, A and B that represent the size of the original sequence (from 1 to N), and the interval [A, B] of the REC transformation in the original sequence that want to know the sum.

He really loves play with sequences of integer numbers. Tired of playing with the same sequence (from 1 to N), Luiz proposed some transformations.:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEVEN(S) and ODD(S) are two transformations that filter even or odd positions of any sequence S, returning a new sequence\n\tREC(S) = REC(EVEN(S)) + REC(ODD(S)).
