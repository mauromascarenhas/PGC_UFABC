{"output":"For each test case, display the case number and the length of the desired route, accurate to two decimal places.","input":"Each test case starts with a line containing the number of vertices N of the polygon (3 ≤ N ≤ 100) and the integer coordinates Px and Py of the robot\u2019s starting point (−10 000 ≤ Px, Py ≤ 10 000). This is followed by N lines, each containing two integers x, y (−10 000 ≤ x, y ≤ 10 000) defining a vertex of the polygon. Vertices are given in counterclockwise order, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, the polygon does not self-intersect, and the robot\u2019s starting point is strictly inside the polygon","level":1,"name":"Room Service","has_images":false,"description":"You are working for a company designing cute, funny robot vacuum cleaners. At a high level, the robots\u2019 behavior is divided into three modes:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tExploration\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVacuuming\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRampant Killing\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tUnfortunately, while consumer testing shows that the last two modes are working perfectly, the exploration mode still has bugs. You\u2019ve been put in charge of debugging.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the beginning of the exploration mode, the robot is placed into a convex polygonal room. It has sensors that should tell it where all the walls are. Your job is to write a program that verifies that these readings are correct. To do this, the robot needs to physically touch every wall in the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYour problem is this: given the shape of a convex polygonal room with N walls and a starting point P inside it, determine the shortest route that touches each wall and then returns to P. Touching a corner counts as touching both incident walls.","id":"2212","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":1,"solved":1,"ratio":"100.00%"}}
