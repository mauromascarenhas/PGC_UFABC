Knowing about that, his friend Werlesson\n          decided to do a challenge for Paulo. Werlesson wants Paulo calculates the N-th power of 9\n          and answer the last digit of that. For example: given N=2, the answer should be 1, because\n          92=81. The difficulty is that 9N for a big N is a very very huge number.\n          Without ideas, Paulo decided ask for your help.","id":"2217","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":1413,"solved":810,"ratio":"57.32%"}}
