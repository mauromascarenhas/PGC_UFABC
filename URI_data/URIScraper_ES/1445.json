There, the winter is a period marked by little rains (same as those at Joinville),Â with cold nights.\n\n                At the university, the students's parties, occurring in almost every Fridays and Saturdays, were big deals. The most interesting is that there were present the most unusual people, poets, singers, teachers, and other artists as well, and of course the students. There was always a reason to make a party, if there wasn't , the reason was to celebrate the tough week at the university.\n\n                The most curious was the system of how the host invited his friends. The owner of the house invited his immediate friends, who also invited others, and so on. On the day of the party, the host wanted to know his/her new friends in order to see how the chain of invitation had propagated.\n\n                To control the number and how the guests came to the party, the host asked everyone who arrived, to write his/her name, and the name of whom had invited him/her.\n\n                Your task is to count how many guests are present at each party, given only the immediate relationship between a guest and a friend.","id":"1445","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":599,"solved":305,"ratio":"50.92%"}}
