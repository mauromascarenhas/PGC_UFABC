{"output":"For each test case print Q lines, where the i-th row is the answer to the i-th query. The response of each query should be composed of two integers separated by space, representing, respectively, the number of words suggested by the program when entering the string indicated by the ith query, and the length of the largest word contained in that subset. If no words are suggested, print -1. Print a blank line at the end of each test case.","input":"The input is composed of several test cases. The first line of a test case has an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of words that have already been searched by the Lucas\u2019 program. Each of the next N lines contains a nonempty string of a maximum of 100 lowercase letters [a - z]. For each test case, N words are different. Then there will be an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 100) indicating the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines describes a query with a non-empty string of a maximum of 100 lowercase letters [a - z], representing a string entered in the search field.","level":4,"name":"Web Browser","has_images":false,"description":"Lucas is a pretty radical guy when it comes to software licenses. Since beginning his undergraduate degree in computer engineering, he seeks to develop all the tools he needs. All this started after bad experiences using proprietary software. Now he believes that a real programmer must be self-sufficient, that is, he must build all the programs he needs, from a simple calculator to his own operating system.\n\nThis semester, Lucas is studying the web systems development course. To continue his philosophy of life, using only software he built himself, Lucas is already programming his own web browser. Much of the work has been completed, but some functionality still needs to be finished.\n\nLucas' browser has a search field where the user can enter a keyword, and clicking a confirmation button it will redirect to another page with the results of his search. When some string is entered in the search field, Lucas wants his program to display, below, some options to auto complete this string according to the searches already performed by the user.\n\nFor example, if the words \"algoritmos\" and \"algas\" have already been searched, when typing the string \"alg\", the program should suggest the words \"algorithms\" and \"algas\". Therefore, for each string entered, the program should suggest previously searched words prefixed with this string. If any word is equal to the typed string, it should also be suggested.\n\nLucas is concerned about the amount of words his program can suggest, and the maximum size they can reach. So he asked you to help him by writing a program where given a few words already searched and a series of queries composed of a string, indicate how many words the browser should suggest to the user, and the length of the largest of these words.","id":"2635","category":"Principiante","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":428,"solved":235,"ratio":"54.91%"}}
