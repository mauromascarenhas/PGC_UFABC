{"output":"For each test case, print a single line with the number of useless packs.","input":"The input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains an integers, N ( 0 ≤ N ≤ 1018 ) representing the number of the last generated bar code, the next line contains an integer M ( 1 ≤ M ≤ 5000 ), representing the number of forbiden numbers, followed by the M unlucky numbers. The last line contain the number zero (0), and should not be processed.","level":10,"name":"Balloon Factory","has_images":false,"description":"Damian just got a job at the new balloon factory in Nlogonia. In this new job he should ensure that every pack of balloons has a different bar code. Trying to do a optimal work he programmed the bar code machine to generate the codes in sequential order starting at zero. Since he is from a foreign country he didn't know about the local superstition about numbers, only after a few days doing this job he was warned that there are M numbers considered unlucky, and because of that, packs with those numbers in the bar code, even if the number is a part of a greater number, can not be sold. Since he knows the bar code of the machine, he thinks you would be able to help him find how many useless packs he produced.","id":"2226","category":"Paradigmas","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":283,"solved":46,"ratio":"16.25%"}}
