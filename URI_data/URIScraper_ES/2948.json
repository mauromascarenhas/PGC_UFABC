A few months after the purchase of this farm, its açaí plantations began to be looted, causing damage to the young farmer.\n\nRangel decided to hire a company to install an electrified fence in order to prevent looters from stealing the remaining açaí feet on his farm.\n\nAs the farm land is perfectly flat, the contracted company has recommended the following fence model:\n\n\n\t\n\tThe fence will be circular;\n\t\n\t\n\tIt will have 4 electrified wires in parallel;\n\t\n\t\n\tThe battery is located in the center of the fence.\n\t\n\n\n\n\nRangel accepted the model, but requested that the fence be sufficient only to surround the remaining açaí feet, as he would have to spend on replacing the looted feet.\n\nYou are an employee of the company you hire and your boss asks you to perform the following task:\n\nKnowing the location of each foot, you should determine the minimum fence that surrounds all remaining açai feet. That is, the coordinate of the battery, the radius of the fence and the amount of electrified wire needed following the model proposed by the company.\n\nFor this problem consider \\(\\pi = 3.14\\).","id":"2948","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":281,"solved":51,"ratio":"18.15%"}}
