The problem now is that almost no program yet written worked with these computers and there was no suitable compiler.\n\n        You have in your hands one of the last full feature computers, and your task is write the compiler. However, since time as money and CPU time is even more money, before performing the whole compilation process, you must only check if it is possible to compile the input program.","id":"1948","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":103,"solved":13,"ratio":"12.62%"}}
