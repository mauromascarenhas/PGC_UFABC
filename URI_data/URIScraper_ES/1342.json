At the beginning of the game each player is assigned a piece; all pieces are initially positioned right before the first square of the trail.\n\n                \n                    The game proceeds in rounds. At each round, players rolls a pair of dice, and move their pieces forward a number of squares equal to the rolled result. Players roll the dice always in the same order (player A, then player B, etc.) in the rounds.\n\n                \n                    Most of the squares on the board are plain squares, but some are \u201ctraps\u201d. If a player\u2019s piece falls on a trap square at the end of the player\u2019s move, the player misses the next round. That is, he/she does not roll the dice, and his/her piece stays one round without moving.\n\n                \n                    There will be exactly three traps on the trail.\n\n                \n\n                \n                    The winner of the game is the player whose piece reaches the end of the trail first. The end of the trail is after the last square of the board. Consider, for example, the board in the figure above, which has squares numbered from 1 to 48. At the start, the pieces are positioned at the place marked \u2018Begin\u2019 in the figure, that is, before the square number 1. Therefore, if a player rolls a 7 (dice showing 2 and 5 for example), his/her piece is positioned at square number 7 at the end of the first round of the game. Furthermore, if a player\u2019s piece is positioned at square 41, the player needs a roll result of at least 8 to reach the end of the trail and win the game. Notice also that there will be no draw in the game.\n\n                \n                    It will be given to you the number of players, the number of squares in the trail, the location of the traps and a list of dice rolls results. You must write a program that determines the winner.","id":"1342","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":1348,"solved":622,"ratio":"46.14%"}}
