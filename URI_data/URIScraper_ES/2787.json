In this way, since the traditional board has eight rows and eight columns, the house on row 8, column 8 (lower right corner) will also be white. In this problem, however, we want to know the color of the square of the board in the lower right corner of a tray with any dimensions: L rows and C columns. In the example of the figure, for L = 6 and C = 9, the square of the board in the lower right corner will be black!","id":"2787","category":"Principiante","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":3748,"solved":2257,"ratio":"60.22%"}}
