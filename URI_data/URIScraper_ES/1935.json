Starting from the top left corner, with coordinates (1, 1), and then going right as possible, then down as possible, then to the left as possible and then up as possible. We repeat this pattern, right-down-left-up, until B beans are placed on the board. The problem is: given N and B data, in which coordinates will be placed the last grain of beans? In the figure, for N = 8 and B = 53, the last grain was placed on the squared coordinates (4, 6).","id":"1935","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":1397,"solved":362,"ratio":"25.91%"}}
