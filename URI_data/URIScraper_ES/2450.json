Today he learned how to make arrays on the ladder shape, and exercising. To help him, you should write a program that determines if the result of it really is in the correct format.\r\n\r\nA matrix is ladder shaped when, for each line, the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIf the line has only zeros, then all rows below it also only have zeros.\r\n\tOtherwise, X is nonzero element of the leftmost line; Then, for all the lines below the line X, all elements in the columns left of X and X are zero.","id":"2450","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":937,"solved":333,"ratio":"35.54%"}}
