Afraid of failing in PL (Programming Language), Nishi need your help to write a program that indents the code automatically.\n\n\n\n- He uses only the operation commands learned (if, else, for, while, switch) and functions, defines, printf, scanf;\n\n- There is no variable with similar command names;\n\n- \u2018;\u2019 is guaranteed only in \u201cfor\u201d  and at the end of the commands based on syntax used in C;\n\nWrong command example:\n\nprintf(\u201c;\u201d);\n\nRigth command example:\n\nfor(i=0;i<10;i++){printf(\u201cHello World\u201d);}\n\n- Ternary operator is not used;\n\nIndentation patterns:\n\n  - Every command (if, else, for, while, switch) starts with '{' in the next line, and ends with '}'in the next line, even if you have a single command; (mind the line break after '}')\n\nExample:\n\nif(1)\n\n{\n\n....printf(\u201cHello World\\n\u201d);\n\n}\n\n- All content whithin the key opening and closing should have a tab to the right, the rule applies to the sub-keys too;","id":"2314","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":396,"solved":71,"ratio":"17.93%"}}
