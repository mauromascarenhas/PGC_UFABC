{"output":"Output a line with an integer representing the number of substhreengs contained in S.","input":"The input consists of a single line that contains a non-empty string S of at most 10 6 characters. Each character of S is either a digit or a lowercase letter.","level":5,"name":"Counting Substhreengs","has_images":false,"description":"Substrings are strings formed by choosing a subset of contiguous characters from a string. This is well known. A little more obscure is the definition of substhreengs. A substhreeng is a substring which complies to the following additional requirements:\n\n                    1. It is non-empty, and composed entirely of base 10 digits.\n\n                    2. Interpreted in base 10 (allowing extra leading zeros), the resulting integer is a multiple of 3.\n\n                    For instance, the string \u201c130a303\u201d contains 9 substhreengs: the substhreeng \u201c3\u201d three times, the substhreengs \u201c30\u201d and \u201c0\u201d twice each, and the substhreengs \u201c303\u201d and \u201c03\u201d once each. The substring \u201c30a3\u201d is not a substhreeng because it is not composed entirely of base 10 digits, while the substring \u201c13\u201d is not a substhreeng because 13 is not a multiple of 3.\n\n                    Notice that two substhreengs are considered different if they are different in length or start at a different position, even if the selected characters are the same.\n\n                    Given a string, you are asked to count the number of substhreengs it contains.","id":"1745","category":"Matem√°ticas","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":574,"solved":267,"ratio":"46.52%"}}
