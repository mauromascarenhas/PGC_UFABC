Each test case starts with an integer N indicating the number of wall sections remaining in the city (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000). Each of the next N\n                    lines describes a wall section. The first wall section to appear is the\n                    section where Indiana Jones stands at the beginning.

Each wall \n                    section description consists of three integers X, Y and L (\u201310000 ≤ X, Y, L ≤ 10000), where X an Y\n                    define either the southernmost point of a wall section (for South-North\n                    sections) or the westernmost point (for West-East wall sections). The \n                    value of L determines the length and direction of the wall: if L ≥ 0, the section is West-East, with length L; if L < 0, the section is North-South, with length |L|.
