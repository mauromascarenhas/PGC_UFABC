In these cases, it is convenient to use the scientific notation.\n\nYou must write a program that, given a floating point number, shows this number in scientific notation: always show the mantissa sign; always show the mantissa with 4 decimal places; use the character 'E' between the mantissa and the exponent; always show the exponent sign; and show the exponent with at least 2 digits.","id":"1958","category":"Principiante","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":10508,"solved":3206,"ratio":"30.51%"}}
