He plans to count the amount of sakura petals that are scattered throughout the yard to serve as an index for the generated sequence of his game. Obviously, he isn't crazy to sweep all the yard and count how many petals are on the floor. So he intends to estimate the amount of petals using his math skills and use a program made by his best Brazilian friend to know if \"she loves me\" or \"she loves not\".\n\nChomsky\u2019s daisy game has an initial symbol and a set of generating rules. From each symbol of the sequence, we can apply the generating rules (ad infinitum) to generate a new sequence.\n\n \n\nKikuka Bakana used the following definition for his game:\n\nInitial symbol: she loves not\n\nRules: (she loves not ==> she loves not, she loves me), (she loves me ==> she loves me, she loves not)\n\n \n\nSample for a 3-step generation:\n\n{she loves not} ==> {she loves not, she loves me}  ==> {she loves not, she loves me, she loves me, she loves not}","id":"2254","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":193,"solved":89,"ratio":"46.11%"}}
