The railroad will be a straight line that will go through the city and it will divide it in two regions. Curo wants the same number of houses in each side of the railroad and it must not pass through a house. Also, to be fair with the citizens of each region, the sum of the distances of the houses to the railroad of each region have to be the same.\n\nThe only problem is that Hailo, the lead engineer of the city, doesn't know if it's possible to build a railroad with the constraints given by Curo.
