{"output":"The number of different paired pairs that can be obtained using a number from A and a number from B.","input":"The input consists of several lines. The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 200) representing the number of elements in the sets. The second line contains N positive integers that belong to A and the third line contains N positive integers that belong to B.\n\t\t\t\tN=0 ends the input. All numbers are 32 bits integers.","level":6,"name":"Paired Pairs","has_images":false,"description":"Maria Luisa loves math, she just won two sets of integers: set A and set B, both sets have the same number of elements. She's playing a game where she creates pairs using elements from these sets.\n\nBut this game was not so fun as she thought, to make this interesting Maria Luisa defined a concept of a paired pair. A pair is paired if the greatest common divisor of the integers from the pair is 1. For instance: (2, 4) is not a paired pair, but (3, 5) is a paired pair.\n\nMaria Luisa wants your help to know how many paired pairs there are such that one pair is composed of an element of A and an element of B. Two pairs (p1, p2) and (p3, p4) are equal if p1 = p3 and p2 = p4.\n\nHere's a complete example:\n\nA = {3, 2}\nB = {2, 5}\n\nThe answer is: 6 and all the possible paired pairs are:\n(3, 2)\n(2, 3)\n(3, 5)\n(5, 3)\n(2, 5)\n(5, 2).","id":"2730","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":405,"solved":161,"ratio":"39.75%"}}
