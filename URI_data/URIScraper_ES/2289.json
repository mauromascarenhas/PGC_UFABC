In another way, it measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other.\n\nThe Hamming distance is named after Richard Hamming, who introduced it in his fundamental paper on Hamming codes Error detecting and error correcting codes in 1950.\n\nIt is used in telecommunication to count the number of flipped bits in a fixed-length binary word as an estimate of error, and therefore is sometimes called the signal distance. Hamming weight analysis of bits is used in several disciplines including information theory, coding theory, and cryptography.\n\nFor example , the binary representation of 910 is 10012 and 1210 is 10102 therefore distance Hamming between them is 2 because you only need to switch the last two bits 10012 to turn in 10102.\n\nYour task is , given two positive integers , calculate the Hamming distance between them.","id":"2289","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":853,"solved":285,"ratio":"33.41%"}}
