{"output":"For each test case, display its number n and the smallest number k > 1 such that f(k) = n. The numbers in the input are chosen such that k < 263. Remember to let a blank space at the end of the line.","input":"The input consists of at most 1 000 test cases, each on a separate line.

While unique, several arrangements of the prime factors may be possible. For example:\n\n                    10 = 2 · 5\n\n                    10 = 5 · 2\n\n                    \n\n                    20 = 2 · 2 · 5\n\n                    20 = 2 · 5 · 2\n\n                    20 = 5 · 2 · 2\n\n                    Let f(k) be the number of different arrangements of the prime factors of k. So f(10) = 2 and f(20) = 3. Given a positive number n, there always exists at least one number k such that f(k) = n. We want to know the smallest such k.","id":"2258","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":53,"solved":6,"ratio":"11.32%"}}
