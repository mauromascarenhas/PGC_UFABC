The next N lines describe the maze and have exactly M characters each, which can be:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tH, if that is the position where Hercules starts his journey;\r\n\tE, if that is the position where Euterpe is arrested;\r\n\t., if that position is a free position;\r\n\t#, if that position is a wall;\r\n\tan integer X between 1 and 9, if that position is guarded by a best that requires X of Herculean energy in order to be killed.","level":6,"name":"Nemesis","has_images":false,"description":"Nemesis, the goddess of revenge, has raged against Euterpe, the Muse of delight, and has put her in a maze infested by beasts. Now, only Hercules can save Euterpe. Starting his journey at somewhere in the maze, Hercules can only advance to a maze position guarded by a best if he kills the beast. Though terrible, a beast can never leave the position it guards. Furthermore, different beasts may require from Hercules different amounts of energy in order to be killed. Help Hercules to save Euterpe spending the minimum of energy as possible, knowing that he can move only in vertical and horizontal directions and, despite of being an invincible hero and having infinite energy, Hercules cannot destroy the walls of the maze.","id":"1972","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":872,"solved":373,"ratio":"42.78%"}}
