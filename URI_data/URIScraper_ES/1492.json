He learned, for instance, that the binary representation of a positive integer k is a string anan−1 · · · a1a0 where each ai is a binary digit 0 or 1, starting with an = 1, and such that k= Σni=0 ai × 2i. It is really nice to see him turning decimal numbers into binary numbers, and then adding and even multiplying them.\n\nCaesar is Carl\u2019s older brother, and he just can\u2019t stand to see his little brother so happy. So he has prepared a challenge: \u201cLook Carl, I have an easy question for you: I will give you two integers A and B, and you have to tell me how many 1\u2019s there are in the binary representation of all the integers from A to B, inclusive. Get ready\u201d. Carl agreed to the challenge.\n\n After a few minutes, he came back with a list of the binary representation of all the integers from 1 to 100. \u201cCaesar, I\u2019m ready\u201d. Caesar smiled and said: \u201cWell, let me see, I chooseA = 1015 and B = 1016. Your list will not be useful\u201d\n\nCarl hates loosing to his brother so he needs a better solution fast.
