They are now posting on facebook in Morse code. You need to write a code to decode Morse!!\n\nThese Morse codes only contain lowercase english letters(a-z) and whitespaces.\n\nNote - Morse code is a way to encode characters as a sequence of dits and dashes. Each character has a fixed encoding. An example of a famous morse code is that of SOS \"...---...\" . S is encoded as \"...\" (dit dit dit) and O is encoded as \"---\" (dash dash dash).\nIn this problem, a dit is denoted by \"=\" and a dash is denoted by \"===\". Symbols are seperated by \".\" , letters are seperated by \"...\" and words are seperated by \".......\" . \nSo, SOS is encoded as =.=.=...===.===.===...=.=.=\nEncodings for all the characters can be found at the link given below.\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://morsecode.scphillips.com/morse2.html","id":"2338","category":"Principiante","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":2328,"solved":951,"ratio":"40.85%"}}
