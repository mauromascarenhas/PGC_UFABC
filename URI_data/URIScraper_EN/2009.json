What most people ignore about him is that he is also a fan of numbers.\n\nLately Jurgen has been studying sorted lists, but he is getting bored. He thinks that such lists are too predictable and not very abundant, so he decided to spice things up a bit.\n\nJurgen says that a list l of N not necessarily different positive integers is just a bit sorted if and only if for each positive integer x > 1 that occurs in l, the number x − 1 appears at least once before the last occurrence of x in l. For example\n\n\u2022 [ 2, 3, 1, 2 ] is just a bit sorted because a 1 appears before the last 2, and a 2 appears before the last 3;\n\u2022 [ 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4 ] is not just a bit sorted because every 1 appears after the last 2;\n\u2022 [ 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3 ] is not just a bit sorted because no 2 appears before the last 3 (since 2 doesn\u2019t appear at all in this list).\n\nJurgen is trying to find out how many different just a bit sorted lists of N positive integers not greater than K exist. Two lists are different if and only if there is at least one position in which the lists have distinct elements. Can you help Jurgen in counting the number of different lists?","id":"2009","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":35,"solved":20,"ratio":"57.14%"}}
