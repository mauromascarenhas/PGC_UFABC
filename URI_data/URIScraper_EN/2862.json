Together with Pana, they go after Tataroko, the birth name of Kogu, to try to dominate the world. It has a tracker that measures the energy level of any living being. All beings with the level less than or equal to 8000, it considers as if it were an insect (\"Inseto\"). When he passes this value, which was the case of Kogu, he is astonished and shouts \"Mais de 8000\", that means \"It's over 8000\".
