But the task of capturing fast slugs is not an easy task, since almost all the slugs are very slow. Each slug is classified at a level depending on their speed:\n\n                    \n                    Level 1: If speed is less than 10 cm/h.\n                    Level 2: If speed is greater than or equal to 10 cm/h and lower than 20 cm/h.\n                    Level 3: If speed is greater than or equal to 20 cm/h.\n\n                    \n                    Your task is to identify which level of speed faster slug of a group of slugs.","id":"1789","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":17459,"solved":9012,"ratio":"51.62%"}}
