The first line in each case initiates an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) representing the number of coins that each girl launched.

They will take a distance from the source and throw alternately N coins each trying to hit it. Each coin may fall inside(dentro) the fountain, on the edge(borda) or outside.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGiven the coordinate (cx, cy) of the center of the fountain, the radius of which is considered inside (r1), and the radius of the edge (r2), your task is the check the throw of both girls and say who hit more coins into the fountain. In case of a tie, the winner is the one that hit more in the edge. If the tie persists, we consider that the game ended in a draw.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNote: If a coin fall exactly into any circle extremes, it shall be considered edge(red dots in the image below).","id":"1920","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":430,"solved":206,"ratio":"47.91%"}}
