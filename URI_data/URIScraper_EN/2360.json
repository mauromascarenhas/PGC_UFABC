{"output":"For each test case output one integer that is the number of ways to keep Syldavia under supervision modulo 109+7.","input":"The input is composed of many test cases. Each test case has one integer N that is the number of regions in Syldavia (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000). The next N-1 lines have the connections between the centrals, two integers A e B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ N).","level":10,"name":"Centrals of Supervision","has_images":false,"description":"Syldavia is a big Kingdom, like many that you probably know. Syldavia have centrals of supervision to control the energy and water transport systems. Each region of Syldavia have one central of supervision. Everything was okay, until the economic crisis.\n\nIn the crisis, the governor of Syldavia decided to cut off expenses. To do that, he installed optical cables between the regions, connecting many pairs of centrals, in the way that each central connected directly or indirectly with all others. As the governor doesn't have a lot of money, he decided use for the N regions, only N-1 cables. There is no central disconnected. The optical cable enabled each central to control one or more centrals that it is directly connected. In other words, centrals could be able to supervision not only its regions, but your neighbors directly connected.\n\nNow, it's possible that some centrals of supervision could be shut down (once your region is supervisioned by other central), so the governor hired you to know how many ways we could shut down centrals in a way that all the Kingdom still under supervision.\n\nObservations\n\nKeep all the Kingdom under supervision means that each region of Syldavia is supervisioned for its own central, or another which is directly connected.","id":"2360","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":81,"solved":25,"ratio":"30.86%"}}
