The second line of the input consists of N integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ 5, 1 ≤ i ≤ N), each one representing the number of people in the buggy i (including the buggyman). Each one of the following lines can consist:\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tof a character 'a' followed by an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), which characterises the abduction of the buggy i (which had not been abducted);\n\n\t\t\t\t\tof a character \u2018?' followed by an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), which characterises that, in that moment, the buggyman of the non-abducted (yet) buggy i would like to know how many people of the excursion remained behind his buggy.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tConsider that the identifier i of a buggy does not change.

Wanting the participants to relax a bit, the symposium organisers hired buggies to take the researchers to some touristic places in the region. The buggies left the hotel in a queue, one after the other.\n\n\t\t\t\tWhoever knows the buggy rides of Ceará knows that the tourist can ask the buggy driver a ride with emotion or without emotion. However, LAGOS excursion faced an extra emotion. Since nowadays in Mars there is a lack of researchers in Graphs, Algorithms and Optimisation, martian aliens started to abduct some buggies, with all people aboard (including the poor driver, who had nothing to do with it). It was very sad for our planet to loose such brilliant minds to Mars, but the tragedy could have been less serious if each buggy driver had been keeping updated the information of how many people in total were in the buggies behind his \u2014 this way he would be able to notice the aproximation of the alien probe and to speed the buggy up.","id":"1804","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":1731,"solved":855,"ratio":"49.39%"}}
