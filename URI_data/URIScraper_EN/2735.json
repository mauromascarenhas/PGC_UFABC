She realized that those numbers can be used to form a permutation: an array of size N in which all numbers from 0 to N-1 appears once. She then remembered that she had kept a very special permutation of size N in her drawer, and she could use it to play with her new blocks. She came up with the following game:\n\nAt day 0, she will arrange the numbers in such a way that 0 is the fist one, 1 the second, and so on, until N-1, forming the array  V0. At day x, she will arrange the numbers to form the array Vx, in which Vx [ i ] = Vx-1 [ P [ i ] ], P being Nina's special permutation.\n\nHer sister Nani got really jealous and decided to question Nina's knowledge about her permutation with questions of the following type: given two numbers J e K, what is the smallest number Y such that VY [ ( J + K ) % N ] = J ?\n\nHelp Nina with her sister's questions.","id":"2735","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":101,"solved":46,"ratio":"45.54%"}}
