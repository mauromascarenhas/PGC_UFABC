Therefore, if a client has cj items on his basket, a specific cashier will take vi*cj seconds to process all of the items from this client.\n\nWhen a client enters the line to be attended he waits until a cashier is free. If more than one cashier are free at the same time, he will be attended by the cashier with the lowest identification number. This cashier will only be free again when he finishes processing all of the clients items.\n\nThere are M clients on the line to be attended, each with a specific number of items on his basket.
