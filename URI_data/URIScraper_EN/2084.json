For a candidate to win in the first round, he should obtain more votes than each of the other candidates. But that is not enough: he should also obtain at least 45% of all the votes, or at least 40% of all the votes and at least 10% more votes than each of the other candidates. This 10% has to be calculated from all votes. If no candidate wins in the first round, a new election is held as a second round.\n\n                    Benicio is a political journalist in Nlogonia, and he always wants to scoop everyone else.
