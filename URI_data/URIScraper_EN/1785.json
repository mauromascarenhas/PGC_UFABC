This number is interesting because of the following fact: let X be any 4-digit number (leading 0\u2019s are allowed) in which not all of them are the same, then Krapekar\u2019s routine starting at this number always converge to 6174. That is, Krapekar\u2019s routine converges to 6174 if, and only if, X is a 4-digit number and at least two of them are pairwise different. Krapekar\u2019s routine is defined as follows:\n\n                    \n\n                    int krapekar(int X) {\n\n                       int cnt = 0;\n\n                       while (X != 6174) {\n\n                           int hi = highest_number_with_digits_of(X);\n\n                           int lo = lowest_number_with_digits_of(X);\n\n                           X = hi - lo;\n\n                           cnt = cnt + 1;\n\n                       }\n\n                       return cnt;\n\n                    }\n\n                    \n\n                    highest_number_with_digits_of(X) is the highest number that can be made using X\u2019s digits.\n\n                    lowest_number_with_digits_of(X) is the lowest number that can be made using X\u2019s digits.\n\n                    \n\n                    For example:\n\n                    highest_number_with_digits_of(3524) = 5432\n\n                    lowest_number_with_digits_of(3524) = 2345\n\n                    highest_number_with_digits_of(10) = 1000 //because 10 = 0010 with four digits.\n\n                    lowest_number_with_digits_of(10) = 1","id":"1785","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":1138,"solved":565,"ratio":"49.65%"}}
