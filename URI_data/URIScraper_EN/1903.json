The first row has two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100000) and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 1000000), representing the amount of species and the number of relationships, respectively. The following M rows have two integers U (1 ≤ U ≤ N) and V (1 ≤ V ≤ N), representing the existence of an unidirectional relationship between U and V.","level":10,"name":"Food Chain","has_images":true,"description":"While Bino was traveling, he drew some food chains of living organisms of Binox.
