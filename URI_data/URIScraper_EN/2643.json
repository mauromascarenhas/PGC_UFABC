{"output":"Display the sum of the squared errors for an optimally chosen set of k allowed integer values.","input":"The first line of the input contains two integers d (1 ≤ d ≤ 256), the number of distinct red values that occurin the original image, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ d), the number of distinct red values allowed in the posterized image. The remaining d lines indicate the number of pixels of the image having various red values. Each such line\ncontains two integers r (0 ≤ r ≤ 255) and  p (1 ≤ p ≤ 226 ), where r is a red intensity value and p is the\nnumber of pixels having red intensity r. Those d lines are given in increasing order of red value.","level":5,"name":"Posterize","has_images":true,"description":"Pixels in a digital picture can be represented with three integers in the range 0 to 255 that indicate the\nintensity of the red, green, and blue colors. To compress an image or to create an artistic effect, many\nphoto-editing tools include a \u201cposterize\u201d operation which works as follows. Each color channel is examined\nseparately; this problem focuses only on the red channel. Rather than allow all integers from 0 to 255 for the\nred channel, a posterized image allows at most k integers from this range. Each pixel\u2019s original red intensity\nis replaced with the nearest of the allowed integers. The photo-editing tool selects a set of k integers that\nminimizes the sum of the squared errors introduced across all pixels in the original image. If there are n\npixels that have original red values r1 , . . . , rn , and k allowed integers v1 , . . . , vk , the sum of squared errors is defined as\n\n\n\nYour task is to compute the minimum achievable sum of squared errors, given parameter k and a description\nof the red intensities of an image\u2019s pixels.","id":"2643","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":28,"solved":10,"ratio":"35.71%"}}
