The first line of each test case contains two integers, N (0 ≤ N ≤ 103) and M (0 ≤ M ≤ N). The second line contains N integers (between 0 and 1000), the value each model has (in nlogonian dollars), in non-decreasing order.The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).","level":3,"name":"3D Virtual Museum","has_images":false,"description":"Vasya and Petya are visiting the 3D virtual museum of history of the capital. To have fun, they decided to do a little prank. The prank consists on damaging M models among the N exposed ones. Vasya illegally downloads the model\u2019s file, Petya opens it in a 3D editor and replaces historical details by Fibonacci numbers, and then he puts it back into the museum.\r\n\r\nEvery time a model is damaged, its value is nullified. Since the duo is really evil, they decided to make the museum have the highest loss possible. Given N, M and the value of each exposed models, write a program to calculate the highest loss they can make.","id":"2548","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":625,"solved":377,"ratio":"60.32%"}}
