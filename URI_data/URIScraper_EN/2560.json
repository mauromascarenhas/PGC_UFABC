In this sport, the athlete stays N minutes inside an aquarium doing some acrobatics with his surfboard, trying to impress the judges.\r\n\r\nThe judges give a grade to the athlete each minute. Thus, an athlete receives a sequence of N grades for each performance.\r\n\r\nA battery (of grades) is a continuous sequence of B grades. The result of a battery is equal to the sum of the grades in it, except for the highest and the lowest grade, that are discarded. Hence, the result of the battery (2, 3, 7, 5), for example, is equal to 8.\r\n\r\nThe final score of the athlete is equal to the sum of the results of all batteries of size B in his sequence of N grades. Hence, if the grades are indexed from 1 to N, we sum the result of the battery with the grades from 1 to B, with the result of the battery with the grades from 2 to B+1, etc., until the battery with the grades from N-B+1 to N.\r\n\r\nGiven the sequence of grades, determine the final score.","id":"2560","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":1196,"solved":264,"ratio":"22.07%"}}
