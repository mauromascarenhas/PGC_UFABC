{"output":"Your program should produce a single line. If there is at least a number n for which A, B, C and D make sense, the line must contain the lowest possible n. Otherwise, the line must contain -1.","input":"The input consists of a single row containing four integers A, B, C, and D, as described above (1 ≤ A, B, C, D ≤ 109).","level":8,"name":"Dividers","has_images":false,"description":"Think a positive number n. Now tell me an A divisor of n. Now give me another B number than n divider. Now a multiple C. and a non multiple D. The number you thought is ...\n\nIt looks like a magic trick, but math! Does knowing the numbers A, B, C and D, you can discover what the original number n? Note that there may be more than one solution!\n\nThis problem, given the values of A, B, C and D, you should write a program that determines which the smallest number n that may have been thought or conclude that there is no possible value.","id":"2238","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":7228,"solved":1084,"ratio":"15.00%"}}
