The first line will have 2 integers N, M (1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ M ≤ N * (N-1) / 2). In the next M lines will have 3 integers U, V, W (1 ≤ U, V ≤ N, 0 ≤ W ≤ 2 * 10³), indicating that the vertex U has a bidirectional connection with the vertex V with a cost of W. The next line will have a integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 10\u2075). In the next Q lines will have a query U, V, K (1 ≤ U, V, K ≤ N).","level":9,"name":"Dabriel's Graph","has_images":false,"description":"Dabriel just won a gift graph and wants to perform some operations on it, however as it is too busy decided to ask for your help.
