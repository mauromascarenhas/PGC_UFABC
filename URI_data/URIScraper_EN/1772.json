{"output":"For each test case print 3 integers separated by space: RES MAX MIN, where RES is the number N after all permutations, MIN and MAX are, respectively, the smallest and greatest intermediate value found in the permutation process. (MAX and MIN must consider the first and last value N assumed as well.)","input":"The first line of a test case contains the integers N (0 ≤ N ≤ 232 - 1) and K (1 ≤ K ≤ 100), representing the starting number and the number of permutations, respectively. Each of the following K lines will contain two space separated integers A and B (0 ≤ A, B ≤ 31), indicating that bits A and B must be swapped. Input ends when N = K = 0.","level":7,"name":"Bit Shuffling","has_images":true,"description":"To find out if his students really understood the lecture about binary representation of integer numbers, Teacher Marcelo came up with the following problem:\n\n                    \u201cGiven an integer number and a sequence of bit permutations for its binary representation, find 3 numbers: the resulting number after all permutations, the maximum and minimum values found during the permutations\u201d.\n\n                    Teacher Marcelo promised one extra point to whoever solved the problem first.
