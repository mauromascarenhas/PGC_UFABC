The first number is the computational cost of the task. It is the computational cost of each complete run of the task. The second number is the period of the process. In other words, the process restarts again after each period.\n\nThe task set will be scheduled using the EDF algorithm (Earliest Deadline First). It is known that EDF is optimal. This means that if a set of tasks cannot be scheduled by EDF, there isn't another algorithm that can schedule it.\n\nThe operating system that will run these tasks runs on a single core machine. The tasks are preemptable. That is, a task can take the place of another task during its run, if required.\n\nConsider that the cost of switching tasks is 0.","id":"2823","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":196,"solved":83,"ratio":"42.35%"}}
