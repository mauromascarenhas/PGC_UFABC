The design for the city is an N × N grid consisting of N avenues running in the North-South direction and N streets running in the East-West direction. Thus, each avenue intersects every street, and no two streets or two avenues intersect each other.\n\n                    As the city is almost finished, it is now time to assign names to its streets and avenues. The people of Nlogonia have already voted on the 2×N names that they want to use, but it hasn\u2019t been decided yet which of those will be used for the streets and which for the avenues. The issue is not so simple, because in each crossing there should be a sign identifying the street and the avenue that intersect there, and the Queen has expressly ordered that the letters in these signs ought to be written in gold encrusted with rubies.\n\n                    Being the official Accountant who Counts the Money (ACM), it is your task to find a way to minimize the total number of letters written in the crossings\u2019 signs, for obvious reasons. Luckily, you have thought of a very clever way to achieve this, which is to use abbreviations for the names of the streets and avenues in the signs. The abbreviation for the name of an avenue (respectively a street) is the shortest prefix of its name which is not a prefix of the name of any other avenue (respectively street). Of course, the abbreviation to be used for each name depends on how the set of 2 × N names is split in two disjoint sets of N names to be used for the streets and avenues.\n\n                    For example, consider the case with N = 2 where the four chosen names are \u201cGAUSS\u201d, \u201cGALOIS\u201d, \u201cERDOS\u201d and \u201cEULER\u201d. If the streets are assigned the names \u201cGAUSS\u201d and \u201cGALOIS\u201d, whereas the avenues are assigned the names \u201cERDOS\u201d and \u201cEULER\u201d, then the abbreviations would be \u201cGAU\u201d for \u201cGAUSS\u201d, \u201cGAL\u201d for \u201cGALOIS\u201d, \u201cER\u201d for \u201cERDOS\u201d and \u201cEU\u201d for \u201cEULER\u201d. With this splitting, the total number of letters to be written in the signs would be 20, as the four intersections would be labeled by \u201cGAU|ER\u201d, \u201cGAU|EU\u201d, \u201cGAL|ER\u201d and \u201cGAL|EU\u201d.\n\n                    However, in the example above it would be more convenient to assign the streets the names \u201cGAUSS\u201d and \u201cERDOS\u201d, leaving \u201cGALOIS\u201d and \u201cEULER\u201d for the avenues. Then, the abbreviations would be \u201cG\u201d for \u201cGAUSS\u201d, \u201cE\u201d for \u201cERDOS\u201d, \u201cG\u201d for \u201cGALOIS\u201d and \u201cE\u201d for \u201cEULER\u201d, and the total number of letters to be written in the signs would be just 8 (as the intersections would be labeled by \u201cG|G\u201d, \u201cG|E\u201d, \u201cE|G\u201d and \u201cE|E\u201d).\n\n                    Fortunately, the set of names that has been chosen is such that no name in it is a prefix of some other name in the set, thereby ensuring that the scheme you propose will always be feasible. Can you calculate the minimum number of letters to be written in the signs if you split the names optimally?","id":"1746","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":116,"solved":40,"ratio":"34.48%"}}
