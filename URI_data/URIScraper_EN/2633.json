{"output":"For each test case, print a single line with the sequence of pieces of meat that Yuri wants to calculate. Each piece must be separated by a single space.","input":"The input is made up of several test cases and ends with and enf of file. The first line of a test case contains an integer N (0 ≤ N ≤ 10), which is the number of pieces of meat from today's barbecue. Then there will be N lines, each with a string of maximum 20 characters, with only characters from 'a' to 'z', and an integer Di (0 ≤ Di ≤ 50) representing the expiration date of the i-th piece. Yuri decided to collaborate and calculate at least this Di number of days until the expiration date, from today, of each piece of meat. It is guaranteed that if i ! = J, then Di ! = Dj.","level":3,"name":"Barbecue at Yuri\u2019s","has_images":false,"description":"Yuri is a good friend. We always do the \"brothers' barbecue ;)\" at his house! This time, the reason for the barbecue is that the brothers are finally starting to pass on good contests! So today we'll have a special edition of barbecue, with alcohol and soap soccer!\n\nThe soap soccer company is taking a long time to fill the field and Yuri, already bored, began to get distracted on the following question: if we baked the meat by the expiration date, what would be the resulting sequence of meat pieces? Since Yuri's MacBook is too far away (and laziness is too close), he asked for your help in answering this question.","id":"2633","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":1969,"solved":928,"ratio":"47.13%"}}
