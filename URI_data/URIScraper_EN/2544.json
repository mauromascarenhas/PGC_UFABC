That way, if a given ninja uses the technique, a copy of that ninja comes to existence, so there are two of the same ninja (the original one and his copy).\r\n\r\nThe technique is always executed by all ninjas existing in the moment. That way, if the technique is used again, there will be four ninjas in total (the two previous ones and two new copies), and so on.\r\n\r\nThere are N copies of a given ninja (including the original one). Your task is to determine how many times the technique was used.","id":"2544","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":3997,"solved":1719,"ratio":"43.01%"}}
