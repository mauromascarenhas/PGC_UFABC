{"output":"For each input set, you should print the message \"Case n:\", where n is the sequential test case number, followed by one line with the level order traversal of the tree, according to the given example.\n                    \n                    Note: None space must be printed after the last number of each line and the program should print a blank line after each test case, even after the last test case.

The first line of input contains an integer C (C ≤ 1000), indicating \n                    the number of test cases that follow. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a number N (1 ≤ N ≤ 500) \n                    indicating the amount of numbers that will form each one of the trees.

It is actually a BFS, which is not recursive by nature. It uses Queue instead of Stack to hold the next vertices that should be opened. The reason for it is in this traversal, you want to open the nodes in a FIFO order, instead of a LIFO order, obtained by recursion.\n                 So the work here is, after some operations of insertion over a binary search tree, print the level order traversal of this tree. For example, an input with the sequence of numbers: 8 3 10 14 6 4 13 7 1 will result in the following tree:\n\n                \n                    \n                With the level order traversal output: 8 3 10 1 6 14 4 7 13.","id":"1466","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":3172,"solved":1227,"ratio":"38.68%"}}
