Each test case has a single line containing a real value A (2 <= A <= 10000), a value B (2 <= B <= 20000), a value C (1 <= C <= 100) and a value D (1 <= D <= 200).

In the period in which it passed in Egypt, it was realized that the Egyptians could not calculate the height of a great pyramid of Cheops and presented a solution to the problem. Tales supposed that the rays of the Sun are parallel when they reach the Earth, because of the distance that separates it from the Sun. (A.J. Philippi .; M.A. Romero; G.C. Bruna (editors)). Let us consider that Tales has chosen a position of illumination of the Sun, such that it is possible to calculate the height of the pyramid given the value of A in meters (width of the pyramid), the value of B in meters (length of the leftover pyramid), of C in meters (the height of any rod) and the value of D in meters (rod length), as shown in the figure.\n\n\n\nSuppose we go back in time and that Tales has now been hired by the Egyptians to calculate the height of all the pyramids in Egypt. However, he does not understand much of programming and asked for his help to develop a system that allows him, through his Tablet, to enter with the data that is provided and the system generate the height of the pyramid.","id":"2873","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":198,"solved":111,"ratio":"56.06%"}}
