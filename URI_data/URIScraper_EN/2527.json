You, Petya\u2019s neighbor and an excellent programmer, heard it and wants to help. Since the cheese police does not allow cheddar to be sold to everyone, you will write a program to facilitate the lady\u2019s purchase.\r\n\r\nEveryone who tries to buy cheddar must pass a luck test. They receive N die (honest ones, with 6 faces valued from 1 to 6) and a number V. All N die are rolled and S is calculated, where S is the sum of the results of all die. If S is greater than or equal to V, cheddar can be purchased. Otherwise, the buyer goes home with empty hands.\r\n\r\nYour program must calculate, given N and V, the probability that Petya\u2019s mom successfully buys cheddar to his son.","id":"2527","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":382,"solved":105,"ratio":"27.49%"}}
