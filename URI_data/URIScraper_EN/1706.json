{"output":"For each test case you should output Y if it is possible the festival to happen or N if it is not.","input":"There will be several test cases.

Princess Bubblegum (PB) asked for many musical towers to be built, with bridges joining them. The tower musical is the new scientific idea of PB, and works as follows. Each tower can output two musical notes: A and B. They start with a random note (A or B), and the goal of the festival is to make all towers output A. That is where the bridges goes in: if you tap a bridge with a special candy wand, it will change the output note of the two musical towers they connect.\n\n                Now Princess Bubblegum got lost on her design and is not sure if the festival can be completed. She gave Finn & Jake, the heroes, a map with the towers, bridges and the starting sound of each tower, and asked them if it's possible to have the festival. Since Finn & Jake are not into \"science stuff\", they asked you to solve this task.","id":"1706","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":473,"solved":179,"ratio":"37.84%"}}
