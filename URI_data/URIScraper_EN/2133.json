{"output":"For each instance, you must print an identifier Instancia K (which means: Instance K), where K is the number of the current instance. On the next line print sim (which means: yes) if N is a Dinostratus number otherwise print nao (which means: no).","input":"The input consists of several instances. Each instance is given by a line containing an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1048576). The input ends with end of file.","level":9,"name":"Dinostratus Numbers","has_images":true,"description":"Recent archaeological discoveries of researchers from the University of Alberta in Canada, showed that a strange sequence of numbers were found on the walls of pyramids in Egypt, in ruins of Macchu Picchu and on the rocks of Stonehenge. Intrigued by the apparent coincidence, the researchers contacted the Department of Mathematics to decipher what was special about that sequence or numbers.\n\n                    The discovery was stunning. All numbers were generated by matrices of Dinostratus. Dinostratus was a famous greek mathematician who lived from 390 to 320 BC and had worked in important geometry problems like squaring the circle. Dinostratus studied matrices M of size 3 x 3 formed by nine distinct integers with the property that for every position (i, j), i = 1 ,..., 3, j = 1 ,..., 3 of matrix, the element Mi,j is a multiple of its neighbors Mi-1,j, Mi-1,j-1 and Mi,j-1 (if they exist). In his honor, we say that N is a Dinostratus number if exist a matrix M with the property above such that M3,3 = N.\n\n                    See an example for N = 36.\n\n                    \n\n                    The relationship between the Dinostratus numbers, the pyramids of Egypt, the stones of the Stonehenge and  the ruins of Machu Picchu still remains a great mystery. Even though, researchers in Alberta are willing to study these magic numbers. Your task is to make a program that receives an integer N and checks whether this is a Dinostratus number.","id":"2133","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":217,"solved":57,"ratio":"26.27%"}}
