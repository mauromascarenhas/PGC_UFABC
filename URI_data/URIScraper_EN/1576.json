{"output":"The output should consist of the vector that describes the skyline as shown in the example above. In the skyline vector (v1, v2, v3, . . . , vn−2, vn−1, vn), the vi such that i is an even number represent a horizontal line (height). The vi such that i is an odd number represent a vertical line (x-coordinate). The skyline vector should represent the \"path\" taken, for example, by a bug starting at the minimum x-coordinate and traveling horizontally and vertically over all the lines that deﬁne the skyline. Thus the last entry in all skyline vectors will be a 0.","input":"The input is a sequence of building triples. All coordinates of buildings are integers less than 10,000 and there will be at least one and at most 5,000 buildings in the input ﬁle. Each building triple is on a line by itself in the input ﬁle. All integers in a triple are separated by one or more spaces. The triples will be sorted by Li , the left x-coordinate of the building, so the building with the smallest left x-coordinate is ﬁrst in the input ﬁle.","level":9,"name":"The Skyline Problem","has_images":true,"description":"With the advent of high speed graphics workstations, CAD (computer-aided design) and other areas (CAM, VLSI design) have made increasingly effective use of computers. One of the problems with drawing images is the elimination of hidden lines \u2014 lines obscured by other parts of a drawing.\nYou must design a program to assist an architect in drawing the skyline of a city given the locations of the buildings in the city. To make the problem tractable, all buildings are rectangular in shape and they share a common bottom (the city they are built in is very ﬂat). The city is also viewed as two-dimensional. A building is speciﬁed by an ordered triple (Li, Hi, Ri) where Li and Ri are left and right coordinates, respectively, of building i and Hi is the height of the building. In the diagram below buildings are shown on the left with triples\n\n(1,11,5),(2,6,7),(3,13,9),(12,7,16),(14,3,25),(19,18,22),(23,13,29),(24,4,28)\n\nthe skyline, shown on the right, is represented by the sequence:\n\n(1,11,3,13,9,0,12,7,16,3,19,18,22,3,23,13,29,0)","id":"1576","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":305,"solved":82,"ratio":"26.89%"}}
