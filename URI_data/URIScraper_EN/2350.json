The game is played on a string S composed of |S| lowercase English letters, s1s2 . . . s|S|. The goal is to find all matchings of a special kind of pattern P in S. The pattern has length N and is defined by a sequence of integers between 1 and 26.\n\nWe consider a contiguous substring sisi+1 . . . si+N−1 starting at position i of S a matching of pattern P if there is a mapping from the numbers in P to lowercase English letters such that the pattern is mapped to sisi+1...si+N−1 but no two distinct numbers are mapped to the same letter.\n\nFor instance, if S is \u201dawawww\u201d and P is [10, 21, 10], the matchings of P are the substrings of S of length three starting at positions 1 and 2: \u201dawa\u201d and \u201dwaw\u201d. Note that \u201dwww\u201d is not an occurence because pattern numbers 10 and 21 would both map to \u2019w\u2019.\n\nAdam and Carol lost the answer sheet and are not sure if they are finding all occurrences for some of the strings in the game. Given S and P can you find the number of matchings for them?","id":"2350","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":926,"solved":201,"ratio":"21.71%"}}
