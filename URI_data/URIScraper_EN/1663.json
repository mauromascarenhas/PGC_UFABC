{"output":"For each test case output whether the permutation is ambiguous or not. Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.","input":"The input contains several test cases.\n\n                    The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000). Then a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows in the next line. There is exactly one space character between consecutive integers. You can assume that every integer between 1 and n appears exactly once in the permutation.\n\n                    The last test case is followed by a zero.","level":2,"name":"Ambiguous Permutations","has_images":false,"description":"Some programming contest problems are really tricky: not only do they require a different output format from what you might have expected, but also the sample output does not show the difference. For an example, let us look at permutations.\n\n                    A permutation of the integers 1 to n is an ordering of these integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is to list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1.\n\n                    However, there is another possibility of representing a permutation: You create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the position of the integer i in the permutation. Let us call this second possibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\n                    An ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be distinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2 for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same. To get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.","id":"1663","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":666,"solved":464,"ratio":"69.67%"}}
