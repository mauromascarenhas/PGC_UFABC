As long as the result would have the digits inverted, this would affect the sequence completed as long as it continues.\n\t\t\t\tFabiano noticed that IccanobiF Sequence can grow even more than the ordinary Fibonacci Sequence and the number 1 doesn't repeat as expected. As long as this is a complex task for him, he decided to hire you to solve this case! It's up to you!","id":"2925","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":214,"solved":95,"ratio":"44.39%"}}
