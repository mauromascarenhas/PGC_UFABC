It is composed by 11 digits and the two lasts are function of the nine previous. In this way, if a person informs a CPF, by mistake or on purpose, it is possible to find out. Let us introduce some notation. Let a CPF be\r\n\r\na1a2a3.a4a5a6.a7a8a9-b1b2\r\n\r\nTo get b1, one can multiply a1 by 1, a2 by 2, a3 by 3, so on, up to a9 by 9 and sum these results. Then, b1 is the remaining of this number when divided by 11, or 0 in case the remaining is 10.\r\n\r\nAnalogous, to get b2, one can multiply a1 by 9, a2 by 8, a3 by 7, so on, up to a9 by 1 and sum these results. Then, b2 is the remaining of this number when divided by 11, or 0 in case the remaining is 10.\r\n\r\nGiven a CPF number, you have to tell whether it is valid or not.","id":"1769","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":4597,"solved":1690,"ratio":"36.76%"}}
