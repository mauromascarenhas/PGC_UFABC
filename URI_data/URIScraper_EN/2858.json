But over time they invented their own variations. Just to challenge each other in new ways. One of the most interesting is the \"infinity row\".\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this version of chess, each player only has a single piece and his goal is to place it in a house adjacent to the initial, either to the left or to the right. The one who manages to do this in fewer moves wins.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe difficulty lies in the movement restrictions of the piece. It can only move in a single line, that is, horizontally, and with each move a player can only move his or her D houses to the right or  E  houses to the left. It's a tricky game, though, to lighten up things a little, they made a program to simulate the board since they would like it to be infinite. Hence the name of the game.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOf course, after a few games, the question began to arise: What is the minimum amount of movement to achieve the goal of the game?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAs William and Levi, despite curious about the answer, are busy playing, your task is, given the number of houses of a movement to the right and the number of houses of a movement to the left, calculate the minimum number of moves to put the piece in a house adjacent to the initial or inform you that it is not possible to do so.","id":"2858","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":286,"solved":63,"ratio":"22.03%"}}
