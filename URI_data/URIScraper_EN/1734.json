{"output":"For each query output 3 numbers on a line: some closest absolute sum and the lower and upper indices of some range where this absolute sum is achieved. Possible indices start with 1 and go up to n.","input":"The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with two numbers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) and k. Input is terminated by n = k = 0. Otherwise, follows n integers with absolute values lower than 104 which constitute the sequence. Then follows k queries for this sequence.

Each signal seems to come in two parts: a sequence of n integer values and a non-negative integer t. We'll not go into details, but researchers found out that a signal encodes two integer values. These can be found as the lower and upper bound of a subrange of the sequence whose absolute value of its sum is closest to t.\n\n                    You are given the sequence of n integers and the non-negative target t. You are to find a non-empty range of the sequence (i.e. a continuous subsequence) and output its lower index l and its upper index u. The absolute value of the sum of the values of the sequence from the lth to the uth element (inclusive) must be at least as close to t as the absolute value of the sum of any other non-empty range.","id":"1734","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":112,"solved":15,"ratio":"13.39%"}}
