{"output":"For each test case, print a line for each query containing the number of opponents currently at the queried region.","input":"The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 1000), the number of rows and columns in the field, respectively. Next N lines contain M integers each, describing the initial positions of the opponents. Integer 0 represents an empty position, while integer 1 represents a position with an opponent. The next line contains an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 105), the number of operations. Each of the next Q lines describes an operation.
