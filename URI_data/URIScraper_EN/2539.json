{"output":"For each test case, print a line containing the total number of high fives that will occur.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105). The second line contains N integers, indicating the order the players are initially in the line. The last integer given in the line is the nearest player to the field.The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).","level":8,"name":"High Five","has_images":false,"description":"The Nlogonian Basketball Team will play the final match of the Basketball World Cup, and the match is about to begin! Right now, the N players are warming up before entering the field.\r\n\r\nPlayers are numbered from 1 to N. Initially, the players are arranged in a line in the edge of the field. The players will enter the field one at a time, in the same order as their number. Hence, player 1 is the first one to leave the line and enter the field. After that, player 2 will leave the line and enter the field, and so on.\r\n\r\nWhen leaving the line, each player salutes every other player that are in front of him in the line with a high five. For example, consider that N=4 and the initial line is 3 1 2 4, where player 4 is the nearest one to the field. Player 1, while going to the field, will salute players 2 and 4 with a high five. Then, player 2 will salute with a high five only the player 4, and will then leave the line. Player 3 also salutes player 4 only (notice that both players 1 and 2 have left the line already). Finally, the last player does not salute anyone.\r\n\r\nYour task is to determine the total number of high fives that will occur.","id":"2539","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":457,"solved":148,"ratio":"32.39%"}}
