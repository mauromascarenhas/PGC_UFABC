{"output":"For each test case in the input, your program must produce a single line, containing exactly one integer, representing the value of the card that maximizes the probability of the player winning the game.","input":"The input contains several test cases. In each test case, the input consists of a single line, which contains two integers A (1 ≤ A ≤ 13) and B (1 ≤ B ≤ 13) that indicates the value of the two first received cards.","level":1,"name":"Tri-du","has_images":false,"description":"Tri-du is a card game inspired in the popular game of Truco. The game uses a normal deck of 52 cards, with 13 cards of each suit, but suits are ignored. What is used is the value of the cards, considered as\t\t\tintegers between 1 to 13.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the game, each player gets three cards. The rules are simple:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Three of a Kind (three cards of the same value) wins over a Pair (two cards of the same value).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t A Three of a Kind formed by cards of a larger value wins over a Three of a Kind formed by cards of a smaller value.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA Pair formed by cards of a larger value wins over a Pair formed by cards of a smaller value.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNote that the game may not have a winner in many situations; in those cases, the cards are returned to the deck, which is re-shuffled and a new game starts.\n\t\t\t\t\tA player received already two of the three cards, and knows their values. Your task is to write a program to determine the value of the third card that maximizes the probability of that player winning the game.","id":"1933","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":10493,"solved":8260,"ratio":"78.72%"}}
