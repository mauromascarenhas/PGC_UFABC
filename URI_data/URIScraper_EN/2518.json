{"output":"For each test case, print a line containing the total area of the ramp\u2019s surface, in square meters. Round and print this value with exactly 4 decimal places.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), the number of steps in the staircase. The second line contains three integers H, C and L (1 ≤ H, C, L ≤ 100), the measures of each step, in centimeters.The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).","level":3,"name":"FNDI's Staircase","has_images":true,"description":"The building of the Federal Department of Natural Islands (FDNI) is being widely reformed to be more accessible. There is a staircase with N steps. Each step is H centimeters high, C centimeters long and and L centimeters wide. Figure (a) shows a staircase with N=4 steps.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tTo make the building accessible, FDNI\u2019s management decided to place a ramp over the staircase. The ramp is hard and has a rectangular format. It will be placed over the staircase in such a way that all its steps are covered, as indicated by figure (b).\n\n\t\t\t\tYour task is, given the number of steps and its measures, determine the total area of the ramp\u2019s surface.","id":"2518","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":1162,"solved":625,"ratio":"53.79%"}}
