For example , to add 15 + 5, the result would be 20 , but with this new idea, the new result would be 2 , and to add 99 + 6 , the result would be 105, but with this new idea , the new result would be 15.\r\n\r\nWrite a program that , given two integers without the digit zero , some the same and, if the result has a zero digit, which remove them before display .","id":"1871","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":7760,"solved":3848,"ratio":"49.59%"}}
