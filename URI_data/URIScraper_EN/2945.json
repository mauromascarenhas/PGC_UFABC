As you know, every monitoring group needs a monitor.\r\n\r\nThis new system has a very particular way of determining whether one student can be monitored by another if they meet both of the following conditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tA student  A  can be monitor of a student  B if the grade of  A  is greater than that of  B. (rA  > rB) \r\n\t A  can only be monitor of  B, if  A is a friend (directly or indirectly) of  B.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you know, the university you study is very large and it is difficult to know how many people a student can be a monitor, because in addition to the grades always change their university contains many students.\r\n\r\nYour challenge is: how many students can any other student monitor.","id":"2945","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":48,"solved":27,"ratio":"56.25%"}}
