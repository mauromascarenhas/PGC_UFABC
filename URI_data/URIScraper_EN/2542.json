{"output":"For each test case, print a line containing \u201cMarcos\u201d if Marcos wins the match, \u201cLeonardo\u201d if Leonardo wins the match, or \u201cEmpate\u201d in the case of a tie (without quotes).","input":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of attributes each card contains. The second line contains two integers M and L (1 ≤ M, L ≤ 100), the number of cards in Marcos\u2019 and Leonardo\u2019s deck, respectively.\r\n\r\nNext M lines describe Marcos\u2019 deck. His cards are numbered from 1 to M, and i-th line describes the i-th card. Each line contains N integers ai,1,ai,2,..., ai,N (1 ≤ ai,j ≤ 109). Integer ai,j indicates the j-th attribute of the i-th card.\r\n\r\nNext L lines describe Leonardo\u2019s deck. His cards are numbered from 1 to L and are described in the same way as Marcos\u2019 deck.\r\n\r\nNext line contains two integers CM and CL (1 ≤ CM ≤ M, 1 ≤ CL ≤ L), the cards chosen by Marcos and Leonardo, respectively. Finally, the last line contains an integer A (1 ≤ A ≤ N) indicating the chosen attribute.The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).","level":4,"name":"Iu-Di-Oh!","has_images":false,"description":"Iu-di-oh! is a card game really popular among kids! Every Iu-di-oh! player has his own deck containing many cards. Each card contains N attributes (such as power, speed, smartness, etc.). Attributes are numbered from 1 to N and are given as positive integers.\r\n\r\nA match of Iu-di-oh! is always played by two players. At the beginning of the match, each player chooses exactly one card from his deck. Then, an attribute is randomly chosen. The player whose the chosen attribute is greater in the card he choose wins the match. If the such attribute is equal in both cards, there is a tie.\r\n\r\nMarcos and Leonardo are in the big final of the Brazilian Iu-di-oh! championship. The great prize is a Dainavision (that is almost as good as a Plaisteition 2!). Given the deck of both players, the card each one chooses and the chosen attribute, determine the winner!","id":"2542","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":3223,"solved":1082,"ratio":"33.57%"}}
