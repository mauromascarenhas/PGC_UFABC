{"output":"For each query in standard input, you should print a line giving the time and the distance travelled, in the format below, using the standard rounding.","input":"Standard input contains several lines of input: Each speed change is indicated by a line specifying the elapsed time since the beginning of the trip (hh:mm:ss), followed by the new speed in km/h. Each query is indicated by a line containing the elapsed time. At the outset of the trip the car is stationary. Elapsed times are given in non-decreasing order and there is at most one speed change at any given time.","level":6,"name":"Average Speed","has_images":false,"description":"You have bought a car in order to drive from Waterloo to a big city. The odometer on their car is broken, so you cannot measure distance. But the speedometer and cruise control both work, so the car can maintain a constant speed which can be adjusted from time to time in response to speed limits, traffic jams, and border queues. You have a stopwatch and note the elapsed time every time the speed changes. From time to time you wonder, \"how far have I come?\". To solve this problem you must write a program to run on your laptop computer in the passenger seat.","id":"1304","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":2013,"solved":781,"ratio":"38.80%"}}
