Trough a map, he knows the location of the N tourist attractions and the M subway stations of the city. To enjoy the tours, he will visit only one point per day. Although, he is pretty lazy and would like to walk the least distance possible between the tourist attraction and one subway station.\n\n                    In another words, choose K distinct pairs of tourist attractions and subway stations, such that the sum of their distance is minimized. The distance is calculated using the Manhattan distance, it is, given a point A and a point B, the distance between them is defined by: D(A,B) = |A_x - B_x| + |A_y - B_y|.
