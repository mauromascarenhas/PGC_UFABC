Since Alice is very organized, at the time of saving the dice she would like to leave all the dices with the same value face up. But since she's also lazy, I'd like to do this with as few moves as possible.\n\nWith each move, it can rotate the dice to show one of the adjacent faces of the current face. Note that in this version of the game, Alice and her friends are using regular, six-sided dices, numbered 1 to 6, where the sum of two opposite faces always results in 7.\n\nHelp Alice determine the least amount of movement required so that all the dices faces the same side up.","id":"2790","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":287,"solved":147,"ratio":"51.22%"}}
