Informally, the Risk Factor is the amount of numbers less than or equal to a certain value N, that aren\u2019t multiples of prime numbers greater than a certain value K.\r\n\r\nMore formally, given the values N and K, the Risk Factor is the number of elements of the following set:\r\n\r\n{x such that 2 ≤ x ≤ N and for every prime divisor p of x, p ≤ K}\r\n\r\nThe engineers need to compute the Risk Factor for different values of N and K and have prepared a set of queries for you to answer.
