{"output":"For each test case, print the message Case #n: indicating the number of test case (as shown below). Follow the vertex of each segment, a segment per line, separated by commas (including a comma at the end of the line). Finishing the test case a message must be printed indicating the number of connected components of the graph. Every test case must have a blank line printed at the end, including the last one.\n                \n                Important: the vertices must be printed in ascending order and if exist path from a to b means that exist path from b to a.","input":"The first line of input file contains an integer N that represents the number of test cases that follows. \n                    Each test case contains two numbers V and E, respectively the number of Vertices and Edges of the graph. Follow E lines, each one representing one of the edges that connect such vertex. Each vertex is represented by a lowercase letter of the alphabet. This mean 26 vertex at maximum (a-z).
