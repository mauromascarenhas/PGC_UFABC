When a singer loses his breath, it takes 1 second for him to recover himself.\n\nThe choir wants to sing a new song, in which there must always exist exactly 3 vocalists singing 3 notes at the same time. When a vocalist loses his breath, another vocalist must assume his place immediately, ensuring that the note keeps sounding. Another characteristic of this song is that all the vocalists must always give their best, or in other words, they must always sing until they are out of breath.\n\nIn order for the presentation to be short, the choir would like to sing this song in the lowest time possible, or in other words, the 3 notes must stop sounding at the same time and as soon as possible.\n\nGiven the amount of choir members, and the amount of time that each of them can sing without losing their breath, you must say what will be the duration of the song.","id":"2799","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":14,"solved":5,"ratio":"35.71%"}}
