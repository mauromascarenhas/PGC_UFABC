Ciro Minino, Hermanoteu, Jonny, Zezinho, Baiano e Pimenta Filosofal enjoy walkig around the beautiful Elysian fields of UnBm to relax and reflect. As time passes, the conversation grows deeper and more abstract.\n\nToday, Hermanoteu was dissatisfied with the convenient solution that the professor gave to a problem, with a simple non-deterministic Toring\u2019s machine. The problem is to decide whether a string of lenght N contains an ordered substring of scoring at least K, where: 1) a substring is obtained by removing zero or more symbols from a string; and 2) the score of a string is the sum of the scores of its symbols. The score of the symbol \u2018a\u2019 is 26, the score of the \u2018b\u2019 symbol is 25, \u2026 and the score of the \u2018z\u2019 symbol is 1.","id":"2627","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":424,"solved":60,"ratio":"14.15%"}}
