{"output":"The single line of the output shall consist singly of the number of numbers with exact K digits which are well-reversible.","input":"The single line of the input consists of a single positive integer K (K â‰¤ 18).","level":3,"name":"melborP A","has_images":false,"description":"A reverse number of a natural number N is the number which we obtain when we read the digits of N from the right to the left. For example, the reverse number of 1234 is 4321 and the reverse number of 150 (a number with 3 digits) is 51 (a number with 2 digits). In this problem, we say that a number is well-reversible if it is strictly less than its reverse number. Examples of well-reversible numbers are 1234, 15 and 819.","id":"2066","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":248,"solved":167,"ratio":"67.34%"}}
