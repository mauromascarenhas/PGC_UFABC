For example , the number 999999999991 , the planet Uno , summing up all the numbers, resulting in 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 1 = 100. Since the number 100 has more than one digit, the process repeats , resulting in 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 One of the great difficulties that people have is to compare two numbers and see which one is greater , under the rules of the planet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWrite a program that , given two integers , identify which one is the biggest one-digit number .","id":"1867","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":3838,"solved":1325,"ratio":"34.52%"}}
