{"output":"For each list encoded by elves, you must submit the message \u201cLISTA #X:\u201d, where X is the number of the list following the sequence (1, 2, 3, ...), then you must list all alphabetically and capital gifts, one in each line.  Print a blank line between two consecutive test cases. At the end of the exit there should be a blank line.","input":"The first line of each test case contains an integer N (1 ≤ N≤ 10000), that corresponds to the number of lines coded by elves. The N  lines contains an indefinite number of integers i (1 ≤ i ≤ 27), each integer i  represents the row of the array, and if i is 27, a space.

As there are thousands of lists and Santa is organized, decided to ask for your help, how does he know that you are dedicated and you know the standard decoding of the elves, released 26 gnomes and goblins 676. Each list is decoded through collaboration of gnomes and elves helpers of Santa Claus. The gnomes are listed from 1 to 26 and for each Gnome, 26 goblins that correspond to letters from A to Z (including the letters K, W, Y). When the decoding is initiated, every N rows are performed. Each line corresponds to a gift. Follow the steps to decode a given list created by Elves:\r\n\r\n                   \r\n                       1st The gnomes are organized representing lines and the goblins are organized representing the columns.\r\n                       \r\n                       \r\n                       2nd For each gnome, is found a goblin.
