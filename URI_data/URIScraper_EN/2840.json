For you who are beginner and do not leave the room without any balloon here is a challenge for you:\n\n\n\tThis year the balloons have a spherical shape, according to the company that produces the balloons: \"... for complex engineering reasons, this format is better (...)\" will understand ...\n\tHowever this format makes the balloon use more helium gas and this caused a problem because the organizer had already bought a tank with L liters of gas before this novelty in the balloon market.\n\n\nKnowing the radius of the balloon model and the amount of helium gas available, could you help the team by saying how many balloons can be filled completely?","id":"2840","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":1121,"solved":741,"ratio":"66.10%"}}
