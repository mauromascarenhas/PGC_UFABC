{"output":"For each test case print a single line with \"Case #R: S\" where R is the number of the test case (starting from 1) and S is the maximum profit Skyrk can get.\n\nConsider the first test case, there are 3 touristic places, 4 binoculars and 2 groups of tourists. The first group of tourists go as follows:The first tourist can pay at most 1 coin. There is no subset Skyrk can choose that satisfy the tourist, so the tourist don't take the tour and pays nothing. The second tourist can pay at most 2 coins, the only choice Skyrk has is to put the binoculars 2 and 4 on the subset, the tourist then chooses binoculars 2 and 4 and pays 2 coins. The third tourist can pay at most 3 coins. Skyrk can put binoculars 1, 2 and 3 on the subset, the tourist then chooses binoculars 2 and 3 and pays 3 coins.The second group of tourists go as follows:The first tourist can pay at most 10 coins. Skyrk can put binoculars 1 and 3 on the subset, the tourist then chooses binoculars 1 and 3 and pays 6 coins.The maximum profit Skyrk can get is 2+3+6 = 11 coins.","input":"The first line contains T (T ≤ 100) \u2013 the number of test cases, after this line T test cases follows.

No surprise this town became one of the biggest tourist attractions in the world. Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to move around the town, since it is very old and surrounded by mountains, its streets are narrow, full of turns and ups and downs. But this was rather fortunate for Skyrk, he thought a lot of tourists would rather see the touristic places looking from the top of the mountains instead of adventuring in the old town. He decided to set sightseeing binoculars on some spots of the biggest mountain near the town, and of course, charge for their use.\n\nThe town has N touristic places, looking from the mountain, they seem to line up from left to right. Skyrk set up M sightseeing binoculars, each can cover the view from touristic place A up to B and cost C coins to use. A group of tourists arrived to do a sightseeing tour, and they want to see all touristic places paying the minimum price. Skyrk knows in advance the price each tourist is willing to pay for the tour. In order to maximize his profit, he will tell the tourist that only a subset of binoculars are working, so that when the tourist choose the ones he wants, he ends up paying more.","id":"1510","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":106,"solved":14,"ratio":"13.21%"}}
