The first line of a test case contains an \n\tinteger N (2 ≤ N ≤ 104) indicating the number of members of the choir. \n\tNotes are indicated by integers. The second line contains N integers, indicating the note (−105 ≤ notai ≤105) where 0 ≤ i ≤ N−1, that each singer must sing at the beginning of the song.

However, she is worried about whether, given a note distribution for the singers, it is possible to reach the end of the song in the way she wants (all singing the same note). And, if that is possible, she wants to know the minimum number of bar measures the song can have.
