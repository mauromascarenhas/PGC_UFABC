{"output":"For each number drawn by Bino and Cino, print the smallest amount of number removal required so that the number is a multiple of 6. If the number can not be a multiple of 6, print the message: \"Cilada\" .","input":"The input consists of multiple lines. The first line contains an integer X ( 1 ≤ X ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases. Each of the next X lines contains an integer Y ( 0 ≤ Y ≤ 10100000 ) indicating a number drawn by Bino and Cino.","level":9,"name":"Funny Game","has_images":false,"description":"Bino and Cino are joking to remove digits from a number to make it a multiple of 6. To perform this game, they draw a number, so they try to remove the fewest number of digits from that number so that it becomes a multiple of 6 without leading zeros.\n\nBino and Cino are very good at this game, and they can always turn the number into a multiple of 6 using as few removals as possible.\n\nFor example:\n\u2022 132: It is not necessary to remove digits because 132 is a multiple of 6.\n\u2022 106: It is necessary to remove the 1 and 0 of the number so that the rest is multiple of 6. It is not possible to remove only the 1, because the result has leading zeros.","id":"2818","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":147,"solved":33,"ratio":"22.45%"}}
