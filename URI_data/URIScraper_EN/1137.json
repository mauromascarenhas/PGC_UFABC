{"output":"For each test case, print a single line with a single integer representing the number of points in one of the largest subsets of the input that are cocircular.","input":"Each test case is given using several lines. The first line contains an integer N representing the number of points in the set(1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Each of the next N lines contains two integers X and Y representing the coordinates of a point of the set (-104  ≤ X,Y≤104). Within each test case, no two points have the same location.\n\n                The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.","level":8,"name":"Cocircular Points","has_images":false,"description":"You probably know what a set of collinear points is: a set of points such that there exists a straight line that passes through all of them. A set of cocircular points is defined in the same fashion, but instead of a straight line, we ask that there is a circle such that every point of the set lies over its perimeter.\n                \n                The International Collinear Points Centre (ICPC) has assigned you the following task: given a set of points, calculate the size of the largest subset of cocircular points.","id":"1137","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":642,"solved":295,"ratio":"45.95%"}}
