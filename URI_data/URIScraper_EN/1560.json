{"output":"For each test, the output consists of one line containing the energy sum of all triangles formed by black points.","input":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with a line with two integers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 100), representing the number of black and white points respectively. After the first line, there are more N + M lines with integer coordinates X, Y (0 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10000) of the black and white points. The N first coordinates represent the black points and the last M lines represent the white points.","level":7,"name":"Triangle Energy","has_images":false,"description":"In a plane there are N black points and M white points, without any 3 collinear points. The energy of a triangle is equal to K2, where K is the number of white points inside the triangle. What is the sum of energy of all triangles that can be formed by the black points?","id":"1560","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":1168,"solved":426,"ratio":"36.47%"}}
