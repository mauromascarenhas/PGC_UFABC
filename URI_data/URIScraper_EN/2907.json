{"output":"Output a single line with an integer indicating the number of distinct triples of lines that can lock the given polygon up.","input":"The ﬁrst line contains an integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 105) representing the number of vertices of the polygon. Each of the next N lines describes a vertex with two integers X and Y (−108 ≤ X,Y ≤ 108) indicating the coordinates of the vertex in the XY plane. The vertices are given in counter-clockwise order and they deﬁne a simple convex polygon. No three vertices are collinear.","level":7,"name":"Escape, Polygon!","has_images":true,"description":"A suspicious-looking convex polygon wants to escape its current position by translating itself along some straight-line direction. Three very diligent straight lines want to lock it up by placing themselves along three distinct sides of the polygon. Then, if the triple of lines deﬁnes a triangle and the polygon lies inside this triangle, it will be locked up. Otherwise, it will escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure (a) above illustrates a triple that will lock the polygon up. For (b), the lines do not deﬁne a triangle since two of them are parallel, and so the polygon will escape. In (c), the polygon lies outside the triangle deﬁned by the triple and it will easily escape.\r\n\r\nGiven a polygon, you must compute the number of distinct triples of lines that can lock the polygon up.\r\n ","id":"2907","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":161,"solved":54,"ratio":"33.54%"}}
