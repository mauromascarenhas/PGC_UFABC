The class has N students and your program must print the note that appears more often in N notes list. If more than more frequent note, you must print the biggest one! For example, if the class has N = 10 students and grades are [20, 25, 85, 40, 25, 90, 25, 40, 55, 40], the most common grades are 25 and 40, taking place three times each .
