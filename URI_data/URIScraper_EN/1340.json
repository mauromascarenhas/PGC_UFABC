Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n (1 <= n <= 1000). Each of the next n lines is either a type-1 command, or an integer 2 followed by an integer x. That means after executing a type-2 command, we get an element x without error. The value of x is always a positive integer not larger than 100. The input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF). The size of input file does not exceed 1MB.","level":4,"name":"I Can Guess the Data Structure!","has_images":false,"description":"There is a bag-like data structure, supporting two operations:\n                \n                    1 x\n                    Throw an element x into the bag.\n                \n                    2\n                    Take out an element from the bag.\n                \n                    Given a sequence of operations with return values, you're going to guess the data structure.
