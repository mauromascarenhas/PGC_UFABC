{"output":"For each test case print a permutation of the integers 1 to n which is both antimonotonic and cyclic. In case there are multiple solutions, you may print any one. Separate all integers by whitespace characters.","input":"The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of a line containing an integer n, (3 ≤ n ≤ 106), the number of integers in the permutation. Input is terminated by n = 0.","level":5,"name":"Cyclic Antimonotonic Permutations","has_images":false,"description":"A permutation is a sequence of integers which contains each integer from 1 to n exactly once. In this problem we are looking for permutations with special properties:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAntimonotonic: for each consecutive 3 values pi-1, pi, pi+1 (1 < i < n), pi should either be the smallest or the biggest of the three values.\r\n\tCyclic: The permutation should consist of only one cycle, that is, when we use pi as a pointer from i to pi, it should be possible to start at position 1 and follow the pointers and reach all n positions before returning to position 1.","id":"1636","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":247,"solved":151,"ratio":"61.13%"}}
