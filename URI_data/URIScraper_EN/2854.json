{"output":"The output consist of a single integer representing the number of different families encountered, based on the documents provided by Armindo.","input":"The input consists of a single test case that contains many rows (can have up to a thousand rows). The first line contains two integers M  (1 < M ≤ 300) and N  (1 < N ≤ 200) that indicates respectively the amount of different people and the existent relationships between them. Each of the next N relationships (listed below), contains three words: a person's name followed by a relation and another name, all separated with space (there is no space after the last name).\n\n\t\t\t\tNote: there will never be a name representing two different people. If there are 2 Pedros, for example, they will be identified by Pedro_1 and Pedro_2 and so on,","level":2,"name":"Family Tree","has_images":true,"description":"Amindo needs your help.
