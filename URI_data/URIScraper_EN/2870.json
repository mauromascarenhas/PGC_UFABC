In one of their trips to one of these several competitions, they decided to create a game. Any game would be boring. Until Júnior came with the following game idea: Júnior had on his cell phone a map with some cities and connections between them. Since Junior has a certain type of OCD, he ensures that for the map to look beautiful, all circuits in that graph are even.\r\n\r\nInitially Junior will put a mark on some city. After the first movement, Thiago and Júnior will alternate their movements respectively. At each round, a player will place a mark on a city immediately adjacent to a mark of the other player. As the map has a finite number of cities, at some point it will no longer be allowed to mark any city. The player who can no longer perform moves is declared a loser, and must bring a cheese loaf sometime during the next marathon.\r\n\r\nJúnior created the game, and now he wants to know. Given the map, can you tell who will win the game when both play optimally?","id":"2870","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":31,"solved":10,"ratio":"32.26%"}}
