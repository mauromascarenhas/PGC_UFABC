Particularly, there is a set of numbers, we will call \"Autopotential\". A number N is called Autopotential when NN  gives a result where the last digits is, exactly, N. For example:\r\n\r\n1: 11 = 1 -> It is autopotential.\r\n3: 33 = 27 -> it is not autopotential.\r\n10: 1010 = 10,000,000,000 -> It is not autopotential.\r\n11: 1111 = 285,311,670,611 -> It is autopotential.","id":"2505","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":550,"solved":174,"ratio":"31.64%"}}
