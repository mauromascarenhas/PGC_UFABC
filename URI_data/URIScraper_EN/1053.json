{"output":"For each case, output the case number followed by the total amount of ink requried with 2 digits after the decimal point. If the lines can\u2019t be drawn without lifting the pen then print ~x( instead.","input":"The first line of input is an integer T(T<20) that indicates the total number of test cases. Each case starts with an integer N(N<10). Then N lines follow, each describing a line segment. A line segment is defined by two points YY1X1 Y2X2. Y1 and Y2 will be from [A,E]. X1 and X2  will be from [1,5]. The first sample is taken from the figure above. So look at the sample for exact format.","level":10,"name":"Continuous Drawing","has_images":true,"description":"A simple task!! You will be given the end points of some line segments.
