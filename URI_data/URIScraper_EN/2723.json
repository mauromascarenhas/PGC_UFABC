To ensure that the sleigh will be balanced, the difference in the sum of gifts on the side A and on the side B can't be greater than 5kg.\n\nYou've got the task to help Santa this year. Given the N gifts, you must find out if there's a way to divide them on the sides A and B, ensuring that the sleigh never gets unbalanced.\n\nNotice that the gifts must be alocated one at a time, in the order they are given on the test case, and at every moment the sleigh should be balanced.","id":"2723","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":466,"solved":164,"ratio":"35.19%"}}
