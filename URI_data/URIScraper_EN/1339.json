The goal of the game is to rotate the faces of the cube in such a way that at the end each face has a diferent color, as shown in Figure 1b.

Figure 2 illustrates a rotation of one of the faces. Gives a scrambled configuration, reaching the final position can be quite challenging, as you may know.\n\n                \n\n                Figura 2: Rotation example\n\n                \n                    But your grandpa has many years of experience, and claims that, given any configuration of the Rubik cube, he can come up with a sequence of rotations leading to a winning configuration.\n\n                \n                    In order to show all faces of the cube we shall represent the cube as in Figure 3a. The six colors are Yellow, Red, Blue, Green, White and Magenta (represented by their first letters).\n\n                \n                    It will be given for you an initial configuration and a list of rotations. A rotation will be represented by an integer number, indicating the face to be rotated and the direction of the rotation (a positive value means clockwise rotation, negative value means counter-clockwise rotation). Faces of the cube are numbered as shown in Figure 3b. You must write a program that checks whether the list of rotations will lead to a winning configuration.\n\n                \n\n                        (a) Colors                                                    (b) Face identifiers for rotations\n\n                Figura 3: Representation of the cube","id":"1339","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":153,"solved":69,"ratio":"45.10%"}}
