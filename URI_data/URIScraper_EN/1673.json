The newline at the end of each line is not encoded, but is passed directly to the output.","input":"The input consists of letters (both upper- and lower-case), digits, spaces, and punctuation. Every line is terminated with a newline character and no other characters appear in the input.","level":7,"name":"Run Length Encoding","has_images":false,"description":"Your task is to write a program that performs a simple form of run-length encoding, as described by the rules below.\n\nAny sequence of between 2 to 9 identical characters is encoded by two characters. The first character is the length of the sequence, represented by one of the characters 2 through 9. The second character is the value of the repeated character. A sequence of more than 9 identical characters is dealt with by first encoding 9 characters, then the remaining ones.\n\nAny sequence of characters that does not contain consecutive repetitions of any characters is represented by a '1' character followed by the sequence of characters, terminated with another '1'. If a '1' appears as part of the sequence, it is escaped with a '1', thus two '1' characters are output.","id":"1673","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":1415,"solved":335,"ratio":"23.67%"}}
