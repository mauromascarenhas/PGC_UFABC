{"output":"For each test case, your program should print a single line, containing a single character: 'S', if it is possible to liquidate all debentures without a bailout from the Central Bank of Nlogonia, or 'N' if a bailout is necessary.","input":"The input consists of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers B and N, indicating the number of banks (1 ≤ B ≤ 20) and the number of debentures printed by the banks (1 ≤ N ≤ 20). The banks are identified by integers between 1 and B. The second line contains B integers Ri separated by spaces, indicating the monetary reserves of each one of the B banks (0 ≤ Ri ≤ 104, for 1 ≤ i ≤ B). The N following lines contain each one three integers separated by spaces: an integer D, indicating the debtor bank (1 ≤ D ≤ B), an integer C , indicating the creditor bank (1 ≤ C ≤ B e D ≠ C) and an integer V, indicating the debenture value (1 ≤ V ≤ 104).\n                \n                    The end of input is indicated by a line containing only two zeros, separated by spaces.","level":3,"name":"Sub-prime","has_images":false,"description":"The most recent economic crisis was partly caused by the manner in which banks made loans to people unable to repay them and resold such loans to other banks as debentures.
