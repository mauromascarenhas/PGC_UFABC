{"output":"For each operation of type 1, print a single line containing the amount of Pomekons that exist between X and Y  stacks after the K-th operation.","input":"The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with an integer N  (1 ≤ N ≤ 10\u2075), representing the quantity of stacks. The second line will have N integers pi (1 ≤ pi ≤ 10\u2075), representing how many Pomekons exist in the stack i.\n        On the next line will be an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 10\u2075), which represents the amount of operations to be performed. Then follow Q lines, representing the Q operations.\n        The input ends with N = 0 and should not be processed.","level":9,"name":"Pomekon Catalog","has_images":false,"description":"After capturing several Pokemons, Dabriel decided to separate them into different stacks and apply some operations on them.
