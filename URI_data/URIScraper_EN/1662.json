{"output":"For each test case output whether the specified square is homogeneous or not. Adhere to the format shown in the sample output.","input":"The input contains several test cases.\r\n\r\n                    The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000). Each of the next n lines contains n numbers, separated by exactly one space character. Each number is an integer from the interval [-1000000,1000000].\r\n\r\n                    The last test case is followed by a zero.","level":7,"name":"Homogeneous Squares","has_images":false,"description":"Assume you have a square of size n that is divided into n×n positions just as a checkerboard. Two positions (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), where 1 ≤ x1,y1,x2,y2 ≤ n, are called \"independent\" if they occupy different rows and different columns, that is, x1≠x2 and y1≠y2. More generally, n positions are called independent if they are pairwise independent. It follows that there are n! different ways to choose n independent positions.\r\n\r\n                    Assume further that a number is written in each position of such an n×n square. This square is called \"homogeneous\" if the sum of the numbers written in n independent positions is the same, no matter how the positions are chosen. Write a program to determine if a given square is homogeneous!","id":"1662","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":59,"solved":35,"ratio":"59.32%"}}
