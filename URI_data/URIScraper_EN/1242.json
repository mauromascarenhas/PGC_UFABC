{"output":"For each test case print a line containing the total number of connections that occurs when the tape is actived.","input":"The input consists of several test cases and ends with EOF. Each test case has a line describing the sequence of bases \n\tof the RNAA stripe. A RNAA stripe contains at least one and at most 300 bases. There are no blanks between bases of a tape. \n\tThe bases are 'B', 'C', 'F' and 'S'.","level":4,"name":"Alien Ribonucleic Acid","has_images":true,"description":"An alien kind of ribonucleic acid (popularly known as RNA) Was discovered. Scientists, for lack of criativity, have named \n\tthe discovery of alien ribonucleic acid (RNAA). Similar to RNA we know, the RNAA is a ribbon composed of several bases. \n\tThe bases are C F B S and may connect in pairs. \n\tThe only possible pairs are between the bases B and S and the bases C and F. \nWhile active, the RNAA fold various intervals of the tape around itself, making connections between its bases. Scientists realized that:\n    \n    When a range of the RNAA tape bend, all the bases in this range will bind to its corresponding bases:\n\t- Each base can bind to only one other base:\n\t- The folds occur to maximize the number of calls made on ribbons\n\n\tThe images below illustrate folds and connections made on tapes.\n    \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tYour task is, given the description of a strip of RNAA, determine how many connections are made \u200b\u200bbetween their bases \n\tif the strip becomes active.","id":"1242","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":2113,"solved":864,"ratio":"40.89%"}}
