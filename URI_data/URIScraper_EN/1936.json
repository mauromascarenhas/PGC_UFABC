{"output":"Its program should produce a single line with an integer representing the smallest amount of factor numbers whose sum is equal to the value of N.","input":"The input consists of a single line containing an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105).","level":2,"name":"Factorial","has_images":false,"description":"The factor of a positive integer N, denoted by N!, is defined as the product of the positive integers smaller than or equal to N. For example 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24.\n\nGiven a positive integer N, you should write a program to determine the smallest number k such that N = a1! + A2! + ... + Ak!, where each ai, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k is a positive integer.\n\nFor example, for N = 10 the answer is 3, it is possible to write N as the sum of three numbers factor: 10 = 3! + 2! + 2!. For N = 25 the answer is 2, it is possible to write N as the sum of two factorial numbers: 25 = 4! + 1!.","id":"1936","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":2273,"solved":1464,"ratio":"64.41%"}}
