{"output":"The output consists of a single line containing theDigit Root.","input":"The input consists of two lines. The first contains the number B (1 ≤ B ≤ 10105). The second contains the number E (1 ≤ E ≤ 10105).","level":9,"name":"Digit Root","has_images":false,"description":"A Digit Root is a feature of numbers used in mathematical recreation, but can also be used to check the results of simple operations such as sum and multiplication. One of its main properties is that the Digit Root of a number is always equal to Digit Root of the sum of its digits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFor example, the Digit Root dofe 18446744073709551615 is the same as 87 because 1+8+4+4+6+7+4+4+0+7+3+7+0+9+5+5+1+6+1+5=87 is the same of 15 because 8+7=15, which in turn is the same as 6, since 1+5=6. Therefore the Digit Root of all these numbers is 6 since 6 is its own  Digit Root.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYour task is, given the two integers, B and E, calculate the Digit Root of BE (B raised to th E-th power).","id":"2859","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":450,"solved":90,"ratio":"20.00%"}}
