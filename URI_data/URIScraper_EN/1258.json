The next N*2 lines contains information of each shirt (will be two lines of information for each shirt). The first line will contain the student's name and the second line will contain the color of the shirt details (\"branco\" -white or \"vermelho\" -red) followed by a space and the size of the shirt \"P\" \"M\" or \"G\".
