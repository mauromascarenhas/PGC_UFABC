However, Juvenal asked to include some dangerous elements in his kit. As Santa could not deny the request ( how to say no to the world most well behaved children?) asked to poor elf Patatatitu to ensure that the present was safe.\r\n\r\nPatatatitu knows a lot about chemistry, and knows every dangerous compound that can be made with the elements available on Juvenal\u2019s kit. Thus, he decided to send a cd together with the gift, containing a program which asserts the safety of Juvenal\u2019s experiments. Everyone agrees that the world\u2019s most well behaved children would never do an experiment without first checking it\u2019s safety as per Santa instructions. However Patatatitu knows nothing about programming and is after someone to help him. Can you help?\r\n\r\nTo elucidate, Patatatitu explains that a dangerous compound are formed from a mix of elements in theirs chemical formula respecting it\u2019s order and proportions. In this kit it\u2019s possible to add one element each time, in various quantities. Thus, to form chlorine trifluoride (ClF3), an extremely dangerous compound, you must add an atom of chlorine (Cl) and three of fluorine (F3), regardless of what was added before or after. ClF4 is not a dangerous compound since it\u2019s a different proportion from ClF3. Similarly, if Mg2F is a dangerous compound, Mg2Fe is safe, since fluorine (F) is different from iron (Fe).","id":"2724","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":327,"solved":181,"ratio":"55.35%"}}
