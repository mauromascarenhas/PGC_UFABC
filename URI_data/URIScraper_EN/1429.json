{"output":"For each test case output a single line containing the decimal representation of the corresponding ACM number.","input":"Each test case is given in a single line that contains a non-empty string of at most 5 digits, representing a number in ACM notation.

He called it \u201cA Curious Method\u201d (ACM for short). The ACM notation uses the same digits as the decimal notation, i.e., 0 through 9.\n\n                To convert a number A from ACM to decimal notation you must add k terms, where k is the number of digits of A (in the ACM notation). The value of the i-th term, corresponding the i-th digit ai, counting from right to left, is ai × i!. For instance 719ACM is equivalent to 5310, since 7 × 3! + 1 × 2! + 9 × 1! = 53.\n\n                Mathew has just begun studying number theory, and probably does not know which properties a numbering system should have, but at the moment he is only interested in converting a number from ACM to decimal.
