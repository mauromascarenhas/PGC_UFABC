{"output":"For each test case output a line with an integer representing the number of non-empty searchable subsets.","input":"Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains an integer F representing the number of files on your hard disk (1 ≤ F ≤ 60). Each of the next F lines indicates the content of one of the files. The content of a file is a non-empty string of at most 104 characters; each character is one of the 26 standard lowercase letters (from 'a' to 'z').\n\n                \n                    The last test case is followed by a line containing one zero.","level":10,"name":"File Retrieval","has_images":false,"description":"The operating system of your computer indexes the files on your hard disk based on their contents, and provides textual search over them. The content of each file is a non-empty string of lowercase letters. To do a search, you specify a key, which is also a non-empty string of lowercase letters. The result is a list of all the files that contain the key as a substring. A string s is a substring of a string t if t contains all characters of s as a contiguous sequence. For instance, \"foofoo\", \"cafoo\", \"foota\" and \"foo\" all contain \"foo\" as a substring, while \"foa\", \"fofo\", \"fioo\" and \u201coofo\" do not.\n\n                \n                    You know the content of each file on your hard disk, and wonder whether each subset of the files is searchable. A subset of the files is searchable if there exists at least one key that produces exactly the list of those files as a result. Given the contents of the files on your hard disk, you are asked to compute the number of non-empty searchable subsets.","id":"1335","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":207,"solved":75,"ratio":"36.23%"}}
