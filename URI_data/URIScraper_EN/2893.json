{"output":"One line per test case should be written with the remainder of the division of the N-th element of the Fibonacki sequence by 1000007.","input":"The first line of the input is composed of the integer 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 which constitutes the number of test cases. The following T lines consist of the test cases, one per line. A test case consists of an integer 2 ≤ k ≤ 105 followed by an integer 1 ≤ N ≤ 2×105.","level":3,"name":"Fibonac^{k}i","has_images":false,"description":"Néchi is a very smart guy. He soon realized in the early years of his academic life that it is a good idea to look for patterns contained in the description of problems to memorize them. It is curious to observe the way he memorized the Fibonacci sequence; he thought as follows: let k be the number of letters \"c\" contained in \"Fibonacci\". Start the sequence by 0,1, ..., k-1 and obtain the next element of the sequence by the sum of the immediately preceding k elements. Develop a program to compute an arbitrary element of the Fibonacki sequence, as Néchi likes to call the problem.","id":"2893","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":163,"solved":60,"ratio":"36.81%"}}
