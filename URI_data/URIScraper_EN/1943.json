Your friend competed, and when asked about his position he told you: \u201cI got placed in the top 10\u201d.\r\n\r\nYou were happy for your friend, but you could not stop asking yourself about what was his real position. \u201cTop 10\u201d could mean any position between first and tenth placed, however if he had placed first he would have said \u201cTop 1\u201d, if he had placed second or third he would have said \u201cTop 3\u201d, and if he had placed fourth or fifth he would have said \u201cTop 5\u201d. Therefore, his real position was between sixth and tenth, because people tend to put themselves in the lowest category they belong.\r\n\r\nYou gathered all the categories people most use: 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100. Given a position K, write an algorithm that says the number of the lowest category this position belongs.","id":"1943","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":4812,"solved":3215,"ratio":"66.81%"}}
