The last test case is followed by a line containing a zero.","level":8,"name":"Very Boring Game","has_images":false,"description":"Annie and Garen love playing computer games but they are not very good on counting. So they need your help in this new game. The game consists of n boxes, each one has a label x. In each box are placed d balls, where d is the number of positive divisors of x, the label of the box. In each turn, a player chooses one ball of any box and removes it from the game. The player who makes the last move is the winner. Given n and x for all boxes, they want to know who will win.
