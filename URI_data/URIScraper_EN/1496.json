{"output":"For each test case, print a line with the indices of all the Ultras in the mountain range, in the order in which they appear in the profile.","input":"The input contains many test cases and ends with EOF. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 105) representing the number of points in the profile.\nThe second line contains N integers Hi indicating the altitudes (in centimeters) of the points, in the order in which they appear in the profile (0 ≤ Hi ≤ 106 for i = 1, 2, . . . ,N). Consecutive points have different altitudes (Hi != Hi+1 for i = 1, 2, . . . ,N − 1), while the first and the last points are at sea level (H1 = HN = 0). You may assume that the profile contains at least one Ultra.","level":8,"name":"Go up the \"Ultras\"","has_images":true,"description":"The topographic prominence of a peak is a measure of special interest to mountain climbers and can\nbe defined as follows: the prominence of a peak p with altitude h, relative to the sea level, is the\ngreatest d such that any path on the terrain from p to any strictly higher peak will pass through a\npoint of altitude h − d. If there is no strictly higher peak, then the prominence is h itself. Those\npeaks with topographic prominence greater than or equal to 150000 centimeters (precision is of great\nimportance to climbers!) have a special name: they are called \u201cUltras\u201d.\nYou have to write a program that identifies all the Ultras that occur in a two dimensional profile\nof a mountain range represented as a sequence of points. Note that the horizontal distance between\npoints is not important; all that you need is the altitude of each point.
