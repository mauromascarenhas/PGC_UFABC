It can be obtained by starting with a row containing a single \"1\" and the next row containing three 1s and then letting subsequent row elements be computed by summing the elements above to the left, directly above, and above to the right:\n\n\t\t\t\t \n\n\t\t\t\tThe first row of the trinomial triangle is numbered as zero, the second row is numbered as one and so on.\n\n\t\t\t\tGiven the row number R, you are asked to write a program that prints the sum of its elements. For instance, the sum of elements at row 2 is 9 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1.","id":"1795","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":4800,"solved":2626,"ratio":"54.71%"}}
