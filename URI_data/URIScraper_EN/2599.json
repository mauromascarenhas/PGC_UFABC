To mitigate  this problem the government will install radars on the avenues, so that each section is covered by a radar. The company that the government contracted has M types of radars available, each of which covers Mi kilometers adjoining the avenue.\n\nYou have been hired by the government to make a program that, given the length of the avenue and the radar coverage area, state how many different ways you can put the radars on the avenue so that it is fully populated.\n\nThe image below shows an avenue of size 4 miles and radars with coverage of 3 and 2 kilometers, each color represents a radar, so it is possible to notice that the distinct amount of cover the avenue are 4.","id":"2599","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":459,"solved":162,"ratio":"35.29%"}}
