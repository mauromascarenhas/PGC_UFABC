In addition, they played something called \"dadinho\" than in other regions, is called \"zezinho\". Each player started with a given and a hunch, threw it on the bench, and hit the result, would take over a given. Each round, the process was repeated with the guess the result of the sum of the dice thrown on the seat. Who hits, would take other dice. The game ends when a player hits a guess after 13 dice at hand. Consider that all data used in the game are honest and have six faces, numbered from 1 to 6. But as increasing the amount of data, was more difficult to hit the shot. Thus, they asked you to make a program which, given a sum of guess, and an amount of data, calculate the probability of hitting such a guess.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWrite a program that - given an integer, representing the sum of guess, and another integer, the amount of data to be played - calculate the probability guess the hit.","id":"2148","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":208,"solved":119,"ratio":"57.21%"}}
