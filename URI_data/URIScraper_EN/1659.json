{"output":"For each test case, output the minimal number of entries that must be kept to satisfy the requirements stated above.

Every test case starts with the number of entries N in the log, where 1≤ N ≤1000. Each of the next N lines contains an entry.\n\n                    Every entry has the format \"mm:dd:HH:MM number ±\", describing the month \"mm\", day \"dd\", hour \"HH\", minute \"MM\", and number (having 1-16 digits) of each call, followed by \"+\" marking a call you definitively want to keep and by \"-\" marking the other calls. The entries come directly from the log of the phone, that is, they are sorted by time of reception of the corresponding call (the last entry is the most recent).\n\n                    You may assume that the recovery procedure described above yields the correct year of each call.\n\n                    The last test case is followed by a 0.","level":7,"name":"Economic Phone Calls","has_images":false,"description":"The phone you bought a long time ago has a built-in memory that keeps track of all the calls you receive. It logs the date (month and day) and the time (hour and minute) of each call along with the caller's number. Only a limited number of calls can be logged (memory was still expensive then).\n\n                    You discover that the limit is almost reached and therefore plan to delete some entries from the log.
