Each document starts with a line containing a single integer, N, which indicates the number of sentences in the document (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000). The following N lines contain each a sentence. Sentences are numbered sequentially, in the order they appear in the input (the ﬁrst is sentence 1, the second is sentence 2, and so on). Each sentence has the form \u201cSentence X is true.\u201d or \u201cSentence X is false.\u201d, where 1 ≤ X ≤ N.\n\n                \n                    The value N = 0 indicates the end of input.","level":5,"name":"This Sentence is False","has_images":false,"description":"The court of King Xeon 2.4 is plagued with intrigue and conspiracy. A document recently discovered by the King\u2019s Secret Service is thought to be part of some mischievous scheme. The document contains simply a set of sentences which state the truth or falsehood of each other. Sentences have the form \u201cSentence X is true/false\u201d where X identiﬁes one sentence in the set.

If the set is consistent, the King wants you to determine the maximum number of sentences which can be made true in a valid truth assignment for the document.","id":"1350","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":85,"solved":49,"ratio":"57.65%"}}
