Processors of the a-C-m family (such as the 1-C-2 and the 5-C-3) have an instruction set with only two different operations:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tA add a\n\t\t\t\t\t\tM multiply by m\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe processor receives an integer, executes a sequence of A and M operations (the program) that modifies the input, and outputs the result. For example, the 1-C-2 processor executing the program AAAM with the input 2 yields the output 10 (the computation is 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 10), while the 5-C-3 processor yields 51 with the same program and input (2 → 7 → 12 → 17 → 51).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou are an a-C-m programmer assigned to a top secret project.
