{"output":"For each query, print the 1-based location of the occurrence. If there is no such element, output 0 instead.","input":"There are several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100,000), the number of elements in the array, and the number of queries.
