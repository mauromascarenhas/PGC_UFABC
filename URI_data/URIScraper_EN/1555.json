Each test case consists of two integers x and y (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 100), indicating the variables to input in the function.","level":1,"name":"Functions","has_images":false,"description":"In the last math class, Rafael, Beto and Carlos learned some new math functions. Each one of them liked one particular function, and they decided to compete to see which function had the higher outcome.\n\nThe function that Rafael chose is r(x, y) = (3x)² + y².\n\nBeto chose the function b(x, y) = 2(x²) + (5y)².\n\nCarlos, however, chose the function c(x, y) = -100x + y³.\n\nGiven the values of x and y, say who chose the function with higher outcome.","id":"1555","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":12988,"solved":7816,"ratio":"60.18%"}}
