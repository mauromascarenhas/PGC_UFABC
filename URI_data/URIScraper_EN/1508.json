{"output":"For each test case output a line with the number of different non-empty subsets of points which can be killed.","input":"The input contains many test cases and ends with EOF. Each test case is described using several lines. The first line contains two integers N and W (1 <= N <= 103 , 1 <= W <= 109) representing respectively the number of points and the maximum width of the laser beam. Each of the next N lines specifies the coordinates xi , yi of the i-th point (0 <= xi, yi <= 109).\n\nThe last test case is followed by a line containing two zeros.","level":10,"name":"Laser Beam","has_images":false,"description":"Once upon a time, there were N points on a plane with distinct integer coordinates. They used to live in perfect peace until a savage, unearthly laser device appeared. This huge machine emits a powerful laser beam that will kill every point lying inside its range.\n\nMore specifically, the laser range is a rectangle with infinite height but limited width, which can assume any positive value less than or equal to W. Fortunately, the beam can be fired only vertically or horizontally (i.e, parallel to Ox or Oy axis). Any point located within the beam area (including its borders) is immediately burned.\n\nThe poor points are worried about which of them are going to get killed. Calculate the number of different non-empty subsets of points the laser can burn by firing a single beam. Two subsets are considered different if there is a point which belongs to one of them but not to the other.","id":"1508","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":91,"solved":22,"ratio":"24.18%"}}
