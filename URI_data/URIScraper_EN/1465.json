So you would better try to solve another problem...\n\n                We have a complex number, a+b*i, where i is the square root of -1. We want to make it simple (I mean, real), by raising it to a natural power. For example, complex number 2+2*i, can be made simple by raising it to 4:\n\n                (2+2*i)4 = -64\n\n                You have to compute the smallest natural number, N, (zero is not included) such that (a+b*i)N is a real number.
