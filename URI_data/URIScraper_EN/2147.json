For this, they obtained a computer that does not process keystrokes, ie, if it is to enter the same letter twice in a row, to press the button twice, as, press for longer, no use. They also measured the time down a key, which was exactly 1/100 second. The challenge would be who typed the word \"Galopeira\" consisting of letters and more, but both were very good, and arrived at a point that it was not possible to count how many letters had been typed. Then asked his help to write a program that checks the typed word and see how much time was spent typing.\n\nWrite a program that, given a typed word, tell how much time was spent to be entered.","id":"2147","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":7368,"solved":4171,"ratio":"56.61%"}}
