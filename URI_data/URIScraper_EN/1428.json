Nessie is usually categorized as a type of lake monster.\n                    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster\n\n                In July 2003, the BBC reported an extensive investigation of Loch Ness by a BBC team, using 600 separate sonar beams, found no trace of any \"sea monster\" (i.e., any large animal, known or unknown) in the loch. The BBC team concluded that Nessie does not exist. Now we want to repeat the experiment.\n\n                Given a grid of n rows and m columns representing the loch, 6 ≤ n, m ≤ 10000, find the minimum number s of sonar beams you must put in the square such that we can control every position in the grid, with the following conditions:\n\n                \n                    One sonar occupies one position in the grid; the sonar beam controls its own cell and the contiguous cells;\n                    The border cells do not need to be controlled, because Nessie cannot hide there (she is too big).\n                \n\n                For example,\n                    \n                 \n\n                where X represents a sonar, and the shaded cells are controlled by their sonar beams; the last figure gives us a solution.","id":"1428","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":1573,"solved":1189,"ratio":"75.59%"}}
