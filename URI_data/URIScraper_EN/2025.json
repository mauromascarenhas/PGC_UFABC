Nowadays Joulupukki receives, besides the traditional letters, a lot of emails from children around the world.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe problem is that Noel has in his computer a virus called Amli.D that changed his name in all draft messages. The good thing is that this virus just mess his name (Joulupukki) changing sometimes the first character, sometimes the last one and often both. So, instead of \"Joulupukki\", the name may appear as \"Joulupukka\", \"SoulupukkA\" or \"Toulupukki\", among other ways.\n\n\t\t\t\tSo you have to build a software to correct all the wrong apparitions of \"Joulupukki\" of Noel email drafts.We have the guarantee of the gnomes that there is no word with more than 10 characters that contains the substring \"oulupukk\", but be careful with the final point, like \"Joulupukka.\", for example.
