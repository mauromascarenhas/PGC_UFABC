He's always seeking the perfect perfomance in his workouts in the gym to compete with his rivals. His friend Frenco assists him the best way possible, helping him seek the trapezius descendens and holding him from bringing down Ibirapuera Park's trees. Nevertheless, BemBem called you to help him in a specific task: to determine his 1RM (one-repetition maximum) average. To do this, you can use the following formula:\n\n\n\nW = Weight to be lifted.\nR = Number of repetitions.\n\nHowever, one of BemBem's arm is weaker than the other, which makes him lift less weight with it, and that's why he asked for your help, claiming that \"the crazy one is sick\". Help him and become a codebuilder!","id":"2144","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":2036,"solved":785,"ratio":"38.56%"}}
