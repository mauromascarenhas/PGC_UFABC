{"output":"For each type 2 operation, prithe number of elements that need to be changed.","input":"The first line contains two integers N and Q (1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 105), which represents how many elements the array has and how many queries Dabriel will perform. The second line contains N integers Xi (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 105) which indicates the value of the ith position of the initial array. In the next Q lines will contain the queries, which can be: 1 X W (1 ≤ X ≤ N, 1 ≤ W ≤ 105), indicating the change operation and 2 X Y W (1 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ N, 1 ≤ W ≤ 105), indicating the query operation.","level":9,"name":"Playing with Queries","has_images":false,"description":"Dabriel is playing with his array and as he is very methodical he thought that he should always know the minimum amount of elements that must be changed so that a given subarray has a value W. In other words, he wants to be able to perform two operations on his array, are they:\n   1 - Change the value of the element of position X to the value W;\n   2 - Inform the minimum amount of elements that need to be changed from the interval [X, Y] so that all elements have the value W.","id":"2800","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":500,"solved":118,"ratio":"23.60%"}}
