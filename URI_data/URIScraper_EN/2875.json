Each case starts with a line containing an integer M (2 <= M <= 100) and an integer N (2 <= N <= 100) representing M rows and N matrix columns of 0s and 1s.

One of his favorites is the game Tunnel, which by the way was created by himself. The game works as follows: A random array is given by 0s and 1s. The cells filled by 0s indicate the path that the object X must pass until there is no more 0s to be walked. Cells filled by 1s indicate obstacles in which object X can not pass.\r\n\r\nAs Jhin is still learning to program, he asked for his help to implement the game, and the goal is to declare that object X always be the start, directed to front, printing the necessary instructions the instructions necessary for X to reach the last cell 0.\r\n\r\nAssume that the instructions are: F (Front), L (Left) and R (Right).","id":"2875","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":56,"solved":36,"ratio":"64.29%"}}
