{"output":"Output the minimum cost to go from campus 1 to campus N.","input":"The first input line consists of two integers N and K (2 ≤ N ≤ 104, 1 ≤ K ≤ 103), which represent respectively the number of campuses and the number of public transport lines created by UFFS. Each one of the K input lines following describes a transport line L and consists of the integer |L| (2 ≤ |L| ≤ 102) followed by the |L| identifiers Ci (1 ≤ Ci ≤ N, 1 ≤ i ≤ |L|) of the campuses by which the ship passes, wherein C1 and C|L| are the endpoints of L. For every campus A and every campus B it is guaranteed that it is possible to go from A to B using UFFS's public transport system.","level":8,"name":"Multicampus UFFS","has_images":true,"description":"It is the year of 2,265, and UFFS (University of the Final Frontier of Sapience) has already got 112.345 campuses around the galaxy. In order to integrate all the campuses, UFFS has created many warp drive public transport lines. The itinerary of each line L is a sequence of |L| ≥ 2 campuses C1, C2, \u2026, C|L|, and each line has only one ship, which passes by all campuses of the line, following the itinerary order, stopping in each of them and making a U-turn whenever it reaches an endpoint of the itinerary, reversing the itinerary order. The transport pass costs Ƀ1 (1 bitcoin, the monetary unit which has become the official currency of the galaxy thanks to the works of Professor Emílio Wuerges at the beginning of 21st century), and has to be paid by the passenger while getting onto the ship, no matter the time the passenger is going to stay in it. This way, the minimum cost to go from campus A to campus B considering the hypothetical lines in the figure below is Ƀ2.","id":"1908","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":791,"solved":197,"ratio":"24.91%"}}
