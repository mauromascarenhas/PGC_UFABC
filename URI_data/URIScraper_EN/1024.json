This program should be able to send coded messages \n\twithout someone been able to read them. The process is very simple. It is divided into two parts. \n\tFirst, each uppercase or lowercase letter must be shifted three positions to the right, according to the ASCII table: letter 'a' should become letter 'd', letter 'y' must become the character '|' and so on. Second, each line must be reversed. After being reversed, all characters from the half on (truncated) \n\tmust be moved one position to the left in ASCII. In this case, 'b' becomes 'a' and 'a' becomes '`'. \n\tFor example, if the resulting word of the first part is \"tesla\", the letters \"sla\" should be moved one position to the left. However, if the \n\tresulting word of the first part is \"t#$A\", the letters \"$A\" are to be displaced.","id":"1024","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":37995,"solved":13402,"ratio":"35.27%"}}
