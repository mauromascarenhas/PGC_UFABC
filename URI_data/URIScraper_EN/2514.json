{"output":"For each test case, print a line containing a number X indicating that the next alignment between the planet and the sun will occur in X years from this day.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains the integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 109), indicating that the last alignment occurred M years ago. The second line contains three integers L1, L2 and L3 (1 ≤ L1, L2, L3 ≤ 103), the time it takes, in years, for each moon to complete its orbit around the planet. It is guaranteed that no alignment occurred in the last M-1 years, and no alignment occurs this year.The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).","level":1,"name":"Lunar Alignment","has_images":true,"description":"In a galaxy far, far away, there is the planet Nlôguérrà, predominantly inhabited by dinosaurs. There are three moons orbiting Nlôguérrà. The orbit of each moon has the form of a circumference whose center is Nlôguérrà, as indicated by the figure in the left:\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWhen all three moons align between the planet and the sun, as indicated by the figure in the right, a horrible catastrophe happens! The last time it occurred, exactly M years ago, a big drought doomed the entire planet, reducing the number of dinosaurs by half. The first moon takes L1 years to complete an orbit around the planet; the second moon takes L2 years to complete an orbit around the planet; and the third moon takes L3 years to do so. Determine how many years will pass until the next alignment.\n\n\t\t\t\tConsider that both the planet and the sun are stacionary.","id":"2514","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":600,"solved":350,"ratio":"58.33%"}}
