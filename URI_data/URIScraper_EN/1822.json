Some buildings in progress are so monumental that, along with the already famous Wall of China can be seen from the moon to the naked eye.\n\n                    A contractor rooted in Shanghai is responsible for the execution of various works in the country. After some time, the contractor's engineers realized that every new work, they had to solve a similar to what had already settled at the beginning of the previous works problem. Tired of always performing the same types of calculations, requested his help in building a program that solved their problem, described below.\n\n                    Consider a work that lasts for n weeks. The i-th week of work, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, fi employees are needed to run it. The costs of recruitment and education of an employee are x yuan. One spends y yuan to dismiss an employee. A necessary expense employee z yuan per week and each additional employee, i.e., that each contract employee is not required in a week of work, costs w yuan a week for the contractor. (yuan is the Chinese currency.)\n\n                    Staff can be hired and fired every week. Initially, the work does not have any employees. At the end of it, all employees should be fired.\n\n                    The problem is to determine the smallest possible value that the contractor should spend with officials throughout the work, always meeting the weekly restrictions. I.e., there can be no less than fi employees working on site in the i-th week.","id":"1822","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":43,"solved":28,"ratio":"65.12%"}}
