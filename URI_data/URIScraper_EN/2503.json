{"output":"For each test case in input, your program must print on output a single line, with the final race classification, indicating team numbers starting from the winner. There must be only one blank space between each team number.","input":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case uses several lines, the first input line has three integer numbers: V, P, T: 0 < V < 20, the average velocity (km/h) to be constant at race; 0 < P < 10 the total control basis; and 0 < T < 20 the total competitors of the race. On the second line there are P integer numbers indicating each base as distance (m) from the start point, 0 < Pi < 4,000. The last control base is the end line for the race. The next T lines contain P integer values each, indicating the time measured (s) for every basis, for each team: team 1 at line 1, and so on. The test cases end with V = P = T = 0.","level":9,"name":"Regularity Race","has_images":false,"description":"One typical kind of race is the Regularity Race. This race has a track to be covered at a constant velocity. To ensure the velocity there are several time control basis. The location of these basis are unknown by the competitors, this is intended to avoid that the competitors try to correct the time just arriving at the base. At every base has a time control counting in the form of penalty points, either for delays as for advances in time. At each control base, if the competitor is delayed, there is 1 point penalty for every second, limited to 1200 points (20 minutes delay) to each base. If the competitor is advanced, there is 2 points penalty for every second, limited to 1200 points (10 minutes advance) to each base. The winner is the one with less penalty points, if two or more has the same points, the winner is who has the smallest team number.","id":"2503","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":215,"solved":37,"ratio":"17.21%"}}
