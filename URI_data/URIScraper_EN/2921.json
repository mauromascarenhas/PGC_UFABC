Each day they note a value in that chart, which expresses respectively the hatred they felt that day and they just stop writing in that chart when the programmer dies, as a way of expressing their love for all the programs he has done for them. The aliens want to know if given a two-dimensional arrangement of positive and negative integers, find the sub-rectangle with the largest sum.\n\n\n\nAs we can see the sub-rectangle of greater sum is the highlighted in blue, 140.
