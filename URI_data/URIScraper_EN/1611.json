The floors are enumerated from 0 to N-1. There is a group of M people wanting to use the elevator, all on floor 0. Each one would like to go to a specific floor. You must decide the order that those people will use the elevator in such a way that the energy used is minimized.\n\n                    Initially, you decide a group of at most C people to enter the elevator on floor 0. Then you must decide the order in which the floors will be visited. Logically, the floors of all people using the elevator must be visited. The energy cost is only when it moves, it is, each time you go up or down one floor you will spend one unit of energy. The process is repeated until there are no more people on floor 0. At the end the elevator must return to floor 0.\n\n                    Given the building size, the elevator capacity and the people information, compute the best strategy that minimizes the energy used by the elevator. Output this energy value.","id":"1611","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":1377,"solved":604,"ratio":"43.86%"}}
