{"output":"For each test case output there must be a serial number of the test case. For each query, write one line of output. The format of this line will depend on whether the number is consulted or not written in one of the marbles. The two different formats are described below:\n\t'x found at y', if the first marble with number x was found at position y. Positions are numbered 1, 2,..., N.\n\t'x not found', if the marble with number x is not present.","input":"There can be multiple test cases. The total number of test cases is less than 65. Each test case consists begins with 2 integers: N the number of marbles and Q the number of queries Meena would make. The next N lines would contain the numbers written on the N marbles. These marble numbers will not come in any particular order. Following Q lines will have Q queries. Be assured, none of the input numbers are greater than 10000 and none of them are negative.\n\tInput is terminated by a test case where N = 0 and Q = 0.","level":5,"name":"Where is the Marble?","has_images":false,"description":"Raju and Meena love to play with Marbles.
