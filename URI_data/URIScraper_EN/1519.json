Rafael then decided to create a blog, where he is going to post all his daily experiences of his life.\n\nFor these free tools, there are characters limits that you can write each day, and Rafael is worried that this limitation will prevent him of telling his best experiences. He decided then to use a word abbreviation system in his posts.\n\nThe word abbreviation system works as follows: for each letter, it is possible to choose one word that has such initial letter and that appears in the post. Once the word is chosen, every time it appears in the post, it will be replaced by its initial letter and a point, then decreasing the number of characters printed at the screen.\n\nFor example, in the phrase: \u201ctoday I visited my parents\u201d, we can choose the word \u201cvisited\u201d to represent letter 'v', and the phrase will be like this: \u201ctoday I v. my parents\u201d, saving five letters. One word can appear more than once in the text, and will be abbreviated every time. Notice that, if after an abbreviation the number of characters does not decrease, then it should not be abbreviated, as with the word \u201cmy\u201d above.\n\nRafael needs his post to have the less number of characters as possible, and because of that he asked your help. For each letter choose a word, in a way that after the abbrevations are applied, the post will have as less characters as possible.","id":"1519","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":2170,"solved":525,"ratio":"24.19%"}}
