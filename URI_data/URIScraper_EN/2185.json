{"output":"For every change in the cells of the game, you should print \"Possivel\" if Dabriel have a chance to win, or \"Impossivel\", otherwise.","input":"The first line of the test case consists of two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10\u2075) and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 10\u2075) representing the amount of stacks and the amount of changes that are made, respectively.\nThe second line consists of N integers vi (1 ≤ i ≤ N, 0 ≤ vi ≤ 10\u2074), representing the amount of Pomekons that i stack contains.\nThe next M lines consist of three integers X, Y, V (1 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ N, 1 ≤ V ≤ 10\u2074), describing the changes that Guarte will perform.","level":7,"name":"Playing with Pomekons","has_images":false,"description":"After capturing many Pomekons, Dabriel and Guarte decided to create a game with the little monsters and who win the game, will be with them all.\n\nThe created game  works as follows: All Pomekons are separated into N stacks, they do not necessarily have the same number of monsters, the player of the round chooses a stack and removes one or more Pomekons. The game ends when there is no monster to be selected, and the player of this round is considered the loser.\n\nAs Dabriel is always the first to play and in the later rounds he's winning, Guarte is suspicious that Dabriel discovered a trick of the game, so he proposed a new rule. In the new version of the game, Guarte will select three integers X, Y, and V, and the number of monsters in each stack between X and Y, will have the V amount of Pomekons. Dabriel accepted the proposal, but he asked for your help to tell if he will have chance to win always that there is a change in the stacks. As Dabriel and Duarte are very good in this game, you can assume that both players always play the best possible way.","id":"2185","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":534,"solved":126,"ratio":"23.60%"}}
