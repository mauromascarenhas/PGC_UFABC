To mitigate this problem the government will install radars on the avenues, so that each section is covered by at least one radar. It is important to know that a radar covers miles along the avenue.\n\nYou were hired by the government to make a program that given the length of the avenue and the radar coverage area, inform the minimum amount of radars needed to cover the avenue.\n\nThe image below shows an avenue of size 15 kilometers and radars with a coverage of 4 kilometers, each color represents a radar, so it is possible to notice that the minimum number of radars needed to cover the avenue is 4.","id":"2598","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":1389,"solved":889,"ratio":"64.00%"}}
