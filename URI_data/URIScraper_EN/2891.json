He gave the name of \"Theorem of the Happy End\" to the following theorem proved  by him and some friends:\n\n\"Given 5 points in the plan, not collinear three to three, four of them always form a convex quadrilateral. \"\n\nThe name of the theorem is due to the fact that one couple of friends who worked on it ended up getting married. Many mathematicians worked on the generalization of this problem, which still was not achieved. In this problem you will prove the theorem and, hopefully, with total happiness! Are given 5 points, not collinear three to three, and you should find the area of the largest convex quadrilateral involving 4 of the given points.","id":"2891","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":56,"solved":29,"ratio":"51.79%"}}
