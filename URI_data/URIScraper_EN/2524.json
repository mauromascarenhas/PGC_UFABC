One day, they made a big mess with the doors of her mansion! The following day, however, they behaved really nice. Due to this, madam Beauvoir decided to reward her grandchildren with strawberry candies.\r\n\r\nRight now, she is at the candy shop to buy the candies. The total number of candies she buys must be such that (i) all candies must be given to her grandchildren; and (ii) every grandchild must receive the same number of candies. Please notice that the number of candies each child receives is irrelevant, provided that everyone receives the same number of candies.\r\n\r\nThere are M candies packages in the shop. Package i (1 ≤ i ≤ M) contains Bi strawberry candies. The seller can only sell entire packages, i.e., madam Beauvoir cannot open a package and buy some (not all) candies from inside it.\r\n\r\nSince she is really rich, she does not care about the price of each package. In fact, to impress the kids, she wants to buy the maximum possible number of packages. Your task is to determine what is the maximum possible number of packages she can buy such that the total number of candies can be divided by her grandchildren.","id":"2524","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":300,"solved":130,"ratio":"43.33%"}}
