On planning you notice that you have to do a lot of operations with sets of friends. There is one group which consist of Arthur, Biene and Clemens. Then there is a group of friends you know from snowboarding which consists of Daniel, Ernst, Frida and Gustav. If you want to invite them both, the resulting party group consists of g1 + g2 (the result is the union of both groups). Then you can compute the intersection of the two groups g1 * g2, which consists of the empty set. Maybe you want to invite a group g1, but excluding all members of an other group g2, which is written as g1 - g2. Intersection (*) has precedence over union (+) and set difference (-). All operations are left associative, which means that in A op1 B op2 C you first have to evaluate A op1 B (provided op1 and op2 have equal precedence).","id":"1726","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":476,"solved":202,"ratio":"42.44%"}}
