For example 9 can be expressed in three such ways, 2+3+4, 4+5 or 9. Given an integer less than (9*1014+1) or (9E14 + 1) or (9*1014 +1) you will have to determine in how many ways that number can be expressed as summation of consecutive numbers.","id":"1568","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":1960,"solved":325,"ratio":"16.58%"}}
