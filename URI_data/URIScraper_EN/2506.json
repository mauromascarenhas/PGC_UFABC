{"output":"For each test case it is requested to print to output on a single line the number of patients who reached the critical condition still in the medical queue.","input":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case begins with a line with the integer N, 0 < N < 25; the number of patients arriving at screening. Following are N lines with the integer values H, M and C, with 7 < H < 19, and 0 ≤ M < 60, the hour and minute that the patient arrives at the screening. The patient on line i always arrives before and at last with the patient of the i + 1 line. And 0 ≤ C ≤ 720, the number of minutes before the patient reaches the critical health condition.","level":9,"name":"Medical Clinic Queue","has_images":false,"description":"Patients who arrive in the Medical Clinic queue go through a medical screening immediately, and then go to the queue to get medical care. In screening, the nurse notes the patient's time of entry and how many minutes he or she has until their health condition becomes critical. It is known that patients in the medical care queue are seen every 30 minutes (always in full hours or half an hour). The beginning of the screening and the attendance is given at 7:00 am, if there is no patient being treated and the queue is empty, the first patient is attended the moment he arrives at the screening. The doctor will attend every patient in the queue. The concern is whether any patient has reached critical condition while not being attended to. For this you have been invited to check in the queue how many patients reach the critical condition.","id":"2506","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":529,"solved":82,"ratio":"15.50%"}}
