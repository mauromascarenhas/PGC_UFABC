{"output":"For each test case, display the winner's name and the amount Q inverted arrows in Bibi format: Q or Bibika: Q. If the game ends in a draw, display Bibibibika.","input":"The first line of each test case contains four integers C ( 1 ≤ C ≤ 104 ) , S ( 0  ≤ S  ≤  5 x  105), A e B, (  1 ≤ A, B ≤ C ), where C is the number of circles, S is the number of arrows, A and B are the ends of the game. Each of the next S lines contain two integers C1 and C2, representing an arrow connecting the circle C1 to the circle C2.","level":6,"name":"Reversing Arrows","has_images":false,"description":"Bibi and Bibika are playing a simple game where the judge, with each round, makes a drawing with several circles and arrows linking some of them.\n\nBibi must count the least X number of arrows that need to be inverted to exist at least one path from A to B and Bibika must count the smallest amount Y of inverted arrows to exist at least one path in the opposite direction from B to A. The game who find the lowest value. If there is no path between A > B or B > A, the game ends in a draw, regardless of the number of arrows reversed.\n\nAs the judge in some rounds makes a very large drawing, it is quite complicated to check the veracity of the answers given by the girls. Your task is to automate this process for him.","id":"2576","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":489,"solved":155,"ratio":"31.70%"}}
