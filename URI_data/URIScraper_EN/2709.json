Robbie Always do a little game with Glória using his coins when she ask to play with him from hide and seek, or when she asks him to take her for a walk. The rule of the game is: Glória have to choose any number N, which will be added, then for each coin N the value of the coin Vi is added until there aren\u2019t no more coins, in other words Ʃ of ((VM-(N*0) )+(VM-(N*1))+(VM-(N*2))...), M it\u2019s the number of coins. For exemple, if there\u2019re 5 coins with values 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and Glória choose 2 as a number of jump, them the coins will be added 5, 3 and 1, result in 9. In the end, Robbie checks if the sum of these coins is a prime number, if this happen, he do what Glória want, if doesn\u2019t happen, the little girl convince Robbie to play again, Cause she Always convince him to do everything, saying that will stop to tell him stories, if he doesn\u2019t make her wish.\r\n\r\nYou as a good developer of U.S Robots, will help this two friends, writting a computer program that will say the result of the game.","id":"2709","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":1106,"solved":141,"ratio":"12.75%"}}
