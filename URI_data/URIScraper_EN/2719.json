The gifts are wrapped, the routes are traced, the reindeer are fed and Noel is happy. It's nearly the time to leave, and Noel must deliver N gifts this Christmas.\n\nThe only problem is that all of these gifts may be too heavy to be loaded on a single trip.\n\nTo solve this problem, Noel stipulated the maximum weight that the sum of the gifts' weight can have on each trip, and now he wants to find out how many trips he will have to make.\n\nGiven the number of gifts, the maximum allowed weight for each trip, and the weight of the gifts, find out how many trips it will take to deliver all the gifts. Notice that the gifts must be delivered on the same order they are given on the input description.","id":"2719","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":1398,"solved":476,"ratio":"34.05%"}}
