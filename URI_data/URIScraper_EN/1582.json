One of the most ancient and most important theorems in History, the Pythagorean Theorem states that, in any right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the catheti. The Theorem has several applications and is the base of many results in Mathematics, Engineering, Physics and Computer Science. Although the Theorem takes Pythagoras's name, it is believed that babylonian mathematicians, even more ancient, had yet knowledge of the formula.\n\n                    \n\n                    We call a positive integers triple (x, y, z) a pythagorean triple if it is possible to exist a right triangle with sides x, y and z, no matter the order the integers appear in the triple. For example, (3, 4, 5), (6, 8, 10) and (5, 13, 12) are pythagorean triples, because 52 = 32 + 42, 102 = 62 + 82 and 132 = 52 + 122. However, triple (6, 8, 10) is just triple (3, 4, 5) multiplied by 2, and, for that, we say that (6, 8, 10) is not a primitive pythagorean triple. A pythagorean triple (x, y, z) is said to be primitive if gdc(x, y, z) = 1. Euclid proved in 3rd century BC that there are infinite primitive pythagorean triples.","id":"1582","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":4756,"solved":2217,"ratio":"46.61%"}}
