{"output":"For each test case, print a line containing the largest possible sum of the sizes of the control fields that can be created. Round and print the answer with exactly two decimal places.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer N (3 ≤ N ≤ 105) giving the number of portals. The next N lines contains two integer xi and yi each (0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 104), indicating the coordinates of the portals in the map.The input ends with end-of-file (EOF).","level":6,"name":"Ingrest","has_images":false,"description":"Ingrest is a augmented reality game widely played across the world. In this game, two factions battle each other in order to control areas in the world.\r\n\r\nThe game map can be described as a plane. There are N portals in the map. A portal i can be described as a point (xi,yi) on the plane.\r\n\r\nFor each pair of distinct portals, a player can create a link between them.\nWhen a link between two portals is created, a line segment connecting them is\ndrawn on the map. Given three distinct portals, when there is a link between each pair of these three portals, a control field is created. A control field is defined as the triangle formed by the links connecting the portals. The size of a control field is defined as the area of this triangle.\r\n\r\nAccording to the game rules, two distinct control fields cannot have a positive-area intersection. Hence, two control fields may share at most a single link or a single portal.\r\n\r\nGiven the positions of all portals in the map, determine the largest possible sum of the sizes of the control fields that can be created.","id":"2541","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":147,"solved":63,"ratio":"42.86%"}}
