The sum will always be greater than 0 and less than 107.","input":"The input has several test cases and ends with EOF. In the first line there is an integer M which represents respectively the number of meters of the string, M <= 105, followed by M * 10 integers MI, which will be glued to the string, following the order from left to right.-105 < MI <= 105.","level":6,"name":"String","has_images":false,"description":"Joao and Cleobaldo cut a white string with M meters and traced a line from left to right int it. For every 10 centimeters of the string was pasted a number and the two would like to know what would be the largest continuous sum between the numbers pasted on the string. This answer could be greater if instead of a straight was a circle, they agreed that they will pick up the end of the string on the right side and make a knot with the left end of the string, now this string is no longer a straight line, and now they want to know what is the maximum continuous sum between the elements. All that is known is that you can use maximum numbers (M * 10) continuous numbers written on the string and get the maximum sum, can you help them.\nAfter they joined the ends of the string the leftmost element is now a continuous element of the element that was to the right.","id":"2917","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":106,"solved":44,"ratio":"41.51%"}}
