After all those years helping mankind, \n                    its members are retiring and now it is time to choose the new members of\n                    the Justice League.\n\n                In order to keep their secret identity, let\u2019s say, secret, super \n                    heroes usually use an integer number to identify themselves. There are H\n                    super heroes on Earth, identified with the integers from 1 to H. With a\n                    brief look at the newspapers anyone can find out if two super heroes \n                    have already worked together in a mission. If this happened, we say that\n                    the two heroes have a relationship.\n\n                There must be only one Justice League in the world, which could be \n                    formed by any number of super heroes (even only one). Moreover, for any \n                    two heroes in the new league, they must have a relationship.\n\n                Besides, consider the set of the heroes not chosen to take part in \n                    the Justice League. For any two heroes on that set, they must not have a\n                    relationship. This prevents the formation of unofficial justice \n                    leagues.\n\n                You work for an agency in charge of creating the new Justice League. \n                    The agency doesn't know if it is possible to create the League with the \n                    restrictions given, and asked for your programming skills. Given a set \n                    of super heroes and their relationships, determine if it is possible to \n                    select any subset to form the Justice League, according to the given \n                    restrictions.","id":"1417","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":118,"solved":52,"ratio":"44.07%"}}
