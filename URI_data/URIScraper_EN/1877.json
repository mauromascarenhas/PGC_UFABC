The snow castle is meant to resemble the actual castle of Winterfell.\n\nThe snow castle can be described as a sequence of N snow towers, numbered from 1 to N from the left to the right. The height of tower i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) is equal to hi centimeters.\n\nSansa says the castle is beautiful if it consists on a sequence of K \"peaks\" alternated with K-1 \"valleys\", like the actual castle of Winterfell. In other words, the castle is beautiful if there is a sequence of K towers T1 < T2 < ... < TK such that:\n\n\n\tThe heights of the towers in the interval [1,T1] are in ascending order;\n\tThere is a \"valley\" in the interval [Ti,Ti+1], for all 1 ≤ i < K;\n\tThe heights of the towers in the interval [TK,N] are in descending order.\n\n\nThere is a \"valley\" in an interval [A, B] if B ≥ A+2 and there is some tower J, A ≤ J ≤ B, such that the heights of the towers in the interval [A,J] are in descending order, and the heights of the towers in the interval [J,B] are in ascending order.\n\nHelp Sansa to determine whether her castle is beautiful or not!","id":"1877","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":441,"solved":320,"ratio":"72.56%"}}
