Here is an example: Gold, Silver, Silver, Silver, Silver, Bronze, Bronze, Bronze, Gold.\n                    \u200bThe corresponding picture will be as shown below:\n\n                \n\n                \n                    If some adjacent boxes are all of the same color, and both the box to its left(if it exists) and its right(if it exists) are of some other color, we call it a 'box segment'. There are 4 box segments. That is: gold, silver, bronze, gold. There are 1, 4, 3, 1 box(es) in the segments respectively.\n\n                \n                    Every time, you can click a box, then the whole segment containing that box DISAPPEARS. If that segment is composed of k boxes, you will get k*k points. for example, if you click on a silver box, the silver segment disappears, you got 4*4=16 points.\n\n                \n                    Now let\u2019s look at the picture below:\n\n                \n\n                \n                    The first one is OPTIMAL.\n                    \u200bFind the highest score you can get, given an initial state of this game.","id":"1331","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":415,"solved":100,"ratio":"24.10%"}}
