{"output":"For each test case determine and print the minimum number of clock cycles required to run the given trace. For further reference see the examples below.","input":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case is composed by two lines. The first line has a\n                    string made out of 1 to 50 characters, where each can be either 'R' or 'W'.  The second line contains an\n                    integer P (1 ≤ P ≤ 10), which represents the number\n                    of processes as a direct indicator of how many read operations can be performed simultaneously. The input\n                    stream ends in EOF.","level":2,"name":"Multiple Reading","has_images":false,"description":"In many computer systems, multiple processes can read from the same resource during the same clock cycle,\n                    but only a single process can write to the resource during a clock cycle.  Reads and writes cannot be mixed\n                    during the same clock cycle.  Given a history of the reads and writes that occurred during a particular\n                    computation as a String trace, and an int procs representing the number of processes used by\n                    the computation, calculate the minimum duration of the computation in clock cycles.  The trace\n                    represents each read as an 'R' and each write as a 'W'.\n                    \n                    For example, if trace is \"RWWRRR\" and procs is 3, then the minimum number of clock\n                cycles is 4: one for the first read, one each for the two writes, and one for the last group of reads.","id":"1262","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":3212,"solved":2066,"ratio":"64.32%"}}
