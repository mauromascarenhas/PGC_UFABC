He knows nothing about programming, so he asked his grandson to make a program that registers and sorts his books by their code. However, his grandson is still in elementary school, and since he knows very little about programming, he ended up making a program that only registers the books, but doesn't sort them.\n\nThereby, Severino has turned to you, because he knows about your programming skills.
