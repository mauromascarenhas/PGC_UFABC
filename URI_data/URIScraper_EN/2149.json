Will usually does some things that his uncle did not like, such as, for example, listen to music at high volume. One day, Phill poses a challenge to his nephew. He would spend the first numbers of a sequence he created. If Will could find the next number in this sequence, his uncle would have to put up with his music, with high volume, and still make a soup for them. If not discovered, Will would have to stop listening to such songs, leaving the quieter uncle. The first numbers of this sequence are below.
