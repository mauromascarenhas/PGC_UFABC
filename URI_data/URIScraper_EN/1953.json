Soon, he had the great idea to talk to all students shouting the call numbers to write down his assistants. Obviously this does not work out, and soon the room collapsed. Everyone wanted to talk at once, and the competition to see who could go faster, there was a tumult of principle, with chairs being thrown on colleagues, hair pulling, and punch in the face.\n\nJunior as a peaceful man, he is trying to fulfill all quickly.
