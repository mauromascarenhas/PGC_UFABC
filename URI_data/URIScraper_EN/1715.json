The first line of a test case contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ M ≤ 100) indicating, respectively, the number of players and the number of matches. Each one of the next N lines describes the performance of one player: the i-th line contains M integers Xj (0 ≤ Xj ≤ 100, for 1 ≤ j ≤ M ), giving the number of goals that the i-th player scored in each match.","level":2,"name":"Handball","has_images":false,"description":"Frustrated and disappointed with the results of its football team, the Super Brazilian Club (SBC) decided to invest in the handball team.
