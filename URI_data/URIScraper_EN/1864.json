In order to make this School happen, many have worked, whether in writing the problems, in configuring the Portal, in making the arrengements for the event or in raising the funds. Our special acknowledgement this year goes to Professor Ricardo Oliveira, who has not only accepted our invitation to come and teach the workshops but has also been participating on the organisation of this School. We are sure that his experience and his career at ICPC as contestant and as coach have motived and inspired us all.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWe hope you have enjoyed these last days in Essos and in Westeros, we hope you have learned a lot and had fun. But it is not only in Essos and in Westeros that you should have fun. Here, in Beyond the Wall, programming is also fun. Keep studying, keep training, and more and more. What is important is the path you choose to pursue from now on. Our advice is that you should always enjoy every single moment, every workshop, every school, every training session, every time practicing or studying at home. Our days are never coming back.","id":"1864","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":10382,"solved":6784,"ratio":"65.34%"}}
