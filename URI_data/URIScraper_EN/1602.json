One of the results somewhat unknown is about the hyperprimes numbers. We say that a number is hyperprime if it has a prime number of divisors. Thus, for example, 25 hyperprime is, because it has three dividers. However 42 is not hyperprime, because it has 8 dividers. \n\n                    Given an integer N, determine the number of hyperprimes in the interval [2, N].","id":"1602","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":1538,"solved":523,"ratio":"34.01%"}}
