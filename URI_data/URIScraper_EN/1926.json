It\u2019s a extremely tiresome work, that needs a lot of time and effort, but nothing that some free time doesn't solves. Someday she received an e-mail, in the e-mail Mari has encountered a very curious problem proposed by the cousins Renè and Leonhard and the twins Isaac and Carl.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe problem is described as the following:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\u201cA natural number is prime, if it\u2019s divided by exactly two numbers: number one and it self (one isn't prime). A number is twin prime, if and only if, it\u2019s prime and there is another prime number b, such that |a - b| = 2. An example: number 3 is twin prime, because it\u2019s prime and there\u2019s another prime (5) with |3 - 5| = 2. But number 23, despite being a prime number, isn't twin prime. Could you tell me how much twin primes there is between two numbers x and y?\u201d\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMarianne loves to solve this kind of problem, but she is busy programming her game. Could you help her?","id":"1926","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":1826,"solved":507,"ratio":"27.77%"}}
