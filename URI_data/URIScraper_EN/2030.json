Sometimes, when the tyre is worn, it is worth to make a pit stop in order to put new tyres and do faster laps. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, it is not always that making a pit stop translates into an advantage. It depends of the quantity of remaining laps and the pit stop time. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe tyres have a life span of few laps until being worn.
