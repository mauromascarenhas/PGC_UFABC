{"output":"If there is only a single number N in a single line then print two non-negative integer numbers a and b, such that a * a - b * b = N. If the number cannot be expressed in such a format then print the line \u201cBachelor Number.\u201d in a single line if such number is even and print the line \u201cSpinster Number.\u201d if the number is odd.\n\n\nIf there are two numbers n1 and n2 in the input then print how many bachelor numbers are within n1 and n2 (including n1 and n2). Note that (n1 ≤ n2 and (n2 - n1) ≤ 1000000).","input":"Each set of input is given in a single line. Each input set may contain one or two signed 32 bit integer numbers.
