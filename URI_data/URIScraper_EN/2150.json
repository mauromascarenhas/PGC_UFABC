And if this is true, they will use the same vowels like us? With this in mind, many scientists have designed various types of alien alphabets, using our alphabet letters, and the digits 0 to 9, with their respective vowels. On this basis, they are asking for help to identify vowels in alien alphabets and make counts about.\n\nWrite a program that, given a sequence of vowels in a given alien alphabet, to count, in a text written with the same alphabet, how many alien vowels the text has.","id":"2150","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":1668,"solved":799,"ratio":"47.90%"}}
