{"output":"For each query, print a single line containing yes if it is possible to choose a square such that your score is not equal to zero, or no otherwise.","input":"The first line contains two integers N and M (1 ≤ N, M ≤ 200) indicating the number of lines and columns of the grid. The next N lines contain M integers each, indicating the grid. Each integer in the grid is not greater than 109.\n\nThe next line contains an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 200) indicating the number of queries. Each of the next Q lines describes a query. Each line contains an integer S (1 ≤ S ≤ min(N,M)), the length of the square you must choose.","level":6,"name":"The Square Game","has_images":true,"description":"The \"square game\" is a very popular game nowadays! The game is very simple: you are given a grid with N lines and M columns containing non-negative integer numbers. The following image shows a grid with 3 lines and 4 columns.\n\n\n\nYou are also given an integer S. You must then choose some square with S lines and S columns contained entirely in the grid. Your score is given by the product of all integers inside the square you chose. For example, if S=2 and you decided to choose the square shown in blue in the given image, your score will be equal to 2×3×2×1 = 12.\n\nYou just realized that, depending on the square you choose, your score may be equal to zero. You are given a grid and a list of queries. For each query, you are given an integer S and must decide whether it is possible to choose a SxS square such that your score is not equal to zero.","id":"2067","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":530,"solved":219,"ratio":"41.32%"}}
