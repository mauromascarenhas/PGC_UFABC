{"output":"The output shows the least time spent in the production.","input":"The input has multiples cases (EOF). The first line has an integer N, the number of steps of the production. The second line has two integers e1 and e2, the time spent to enter in each of the assembly lines. The next line has N values, a11, a12, ..., a1n, representing the time spent to execute the ith step on line 1. The next line has also N valores, a21, a22, ..., a2n representing the time spent to execute the ith step on line 2. The next two lines have N-1 integers  representing the time to switch from line 1 to line 2, t11, t12, ..., t1n-1 and from line 2 to line 1,  t21, t22, ..., t2n-1, respectively.

Having those informations, it is possible to optimize the production and reduce the time spent to have everything done.\n\nAn industry has the following production scheme:\n\n\n\nKnowing the time spent in each station, and the time required to swich between the assembly lines, calculate the least time spent to produce a single item.","id":"2769","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":263,"solved":137,"ratio":"52.09%"}}
