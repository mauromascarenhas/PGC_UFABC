{"output":"For each test case, print the number of optimal symmetric paths, modulo 1,000,000,009 .","input":"There will be at most 25 test cases. Each test case begins with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the next n lines contains n non-zero digits (i.e. one of 1, 2, 3, ..., 9). These n2 integers are the digits in the grid.\n\n                The input is terminated by a test case with n = 0, you should not process it.","level":8,"name":"Optimal Symmetric Paths","has_images":true,"description":"You have a grid of n rows and n columns. Each of the unit squares contains a non-zero digit. You walk from the top-left square to the bottom-right square. Each step, you can move left, right, up or down to the adjacent square (you cannot move diagonally), but you cannot visit a square more than once. There is another interesting rule: your path must be symmetric about the line connecting the bottom-left square and top-right square. Below is a symmetric path in a 6 x 6 grid.\n\n                \n\n                Your task is to find out, among all valid paths, how many of them have the minimal sum of digits?","id":"1461","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":96,"solved":38,"ratio":"39.58%"}}
