{"output":"For each query of each test case, print one line with the requested probability, with six decimal places.","input":"The input is composed of several test cases and ends with end of file. The first line of a test case contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5), which is the number of locations where the Yellow Shows can perform. Locations are labeled 1 to N. After that there will be N lines, each with N numbers. The i-th number of the j-th line is the probability of the next concert being in location j, since the last concert was in location i. The next line contains a single integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 100), the number of queries that Pepper will make. Each of the next Q lines contains the integers i, j, and K (1 ≤ K ≤ 10^6) of a query.","level":3,"name":"Rodoido","has_images":false,"description":"Rodoido has an Arctic Monkeys cover band and often plays in concerts at Brasilia. The band performs in several places, such as Velvet Pub, Amsterdam Street and Stadt Bier, which ends up hindering Pimenta to watch all the concerts! He never knows where the Yellow Shoes will perform next. To solve this problem, Pimenta decided to collect data from presentations and make estimates. He was able to calculate the probability of the next concert being in place j, given that the last concert was in place i. However, he is not able to calculate the probability of the K-th concert being in place j, given that the initial concert was in place i, and asked for his help to finish this task.","id":"2629","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":85,"solved":57,"ratio":"67.06%"}}
