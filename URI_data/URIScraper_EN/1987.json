A natural number is divisible by 3 as the sum of all its digits forms a number divisible by 3, i.e. a multiple of 3 .\n\nEx1: 1.104 is divisible by 3?\n\nAnswer: \u201cYES\u201d. It is divisible by 3 , when added as their numbers : 1 + 1 + 0 + 4 = 6 , which is a number divisible by 3 (because 6 รท 3 = 2, which is a natural number).\n\nEx1: 2.791.035 is divisible by 3?\n\nAnswer: \u201cYES\u201d . 2791035 consists of figures added : 9 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 3 + 5 = 27 , generates a number divisible by 3 (because 27 รท 3 = 9 , natural number).","id":"1987","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":2848,"solved":1336,"ratio":"46.91%"}}
