There is a city, according to your teacher, where the people take really seriously the way they talk to each other. In particular, when two people are talking, they think a lot in the sentence that they are going to say before they say it, so that they can ensure their sentence will be a \u201cfull sentence\u201d, or maybe an \u201calmost full sentence\u201d.\n\nConsidering our 26 letters alphabet, a sentence is \u201cfull\u201d if, and only if, it has all the letters of our alphabet in it. In a similar way, a sentence is \u201calmost full\u201d if, and only if, it is not \u201cfull\u201d, but has at least half of the letters of our alphabet in it. When a sentence is not \u201cfull\u201d neither \u201calmost full\u201d, it is \u201cpoorly designed\u201d.\n\nYour teacher gave you a really hard task: given several sentences exchanged between several people from the quoted city, say in which of the given categories each sentence fits in.","id":"1551","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":8930,"solved":3456,"ratio":"38.70%"}}
