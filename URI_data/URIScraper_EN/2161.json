This method uses as denominator a repetition for fractions. This repetition can be done by a fixed number of times.\n\nFor example, by repeating 2 times the continued fraction to calculate the square root of 10, we have the following equation.\n\n\n\nYour task is to calculate the approximate value of square root of 10 given the number N of repetitions.","id":"2161","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":3582,"solved":2584,"ratio":"72.14%"}}
