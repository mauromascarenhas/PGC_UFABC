{"output":"Print the \u201csquare\u201d of each matrix of the input, according to the meaning of the \u201csquare\u201d of a matrix to Atrapalhilton. Before printing each \u201csquare\u201d, print the line \u201cQuadrado da matriz #x:\u201d (without the quotation marks), in order to help Atrapalhilton not to get lost while writing out the results to the notebook. Start the counting in x = 4, after all, Atrapalhilton has already calculated the \u201csquares\u201d of the first 3 matrices. Add as much blank spaces as needed to the left of each value in order to get the values of a same column altogether flush right, so that there is a blank space in addition to the mandatory blank space which separates consecutive columns. Print also a blank line between two consecutive \u201csquares\u201d of matrices.","input":"The first line of the input consists of a single positive integer N (N ≤ 100), which stands for the number of matrices whose \u201csquares\u201d have not been calculated yet. Follow the description of each one of the N matrices. The first line of the description of a matrix consists of a single integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 20), which represents the number of lines and the number of columns of the matrix. Follow, then, M lines, each one of M integers aij (0 ≤ aij ≤ 232-1, 1 ≤ i,j ≤ M), which correspond to the cells of the matrix, in a way such that consecutive values in a same line are separated by a blank space.","level":7,"name":"Matrix of Squares","has_images":false,"description":"Atrapalhilton is a student very dedicated, though very, very clumsky. Last week, his Math teacher, Mr. Sabetudilton, recommended the class a list of exercises about matrices. Atrapalhilton, diligent as he is, decided to make the exercises at the very same day, as soon he arrived home, though only after watching the evening episode of The Striped Little Hen, his favorite TV show. In the statement of one of the exercises it could be read:\n\n                    \n                    \tCalculate the square of each one of the matrices below\u2026\n                    \n\n                    However, Atrpalhilton made a huge mass. For him, the square of a square matrix A is the matrix of the squares of the values of matrix A. For example, the square of matrix\n\n                    \n                      \n                        1\n                        3\n                      \n                      \n                        5\n                        7\n                      \n                    \n\n                    is not for him,\n\n                    \n                      \n                        16\n                        24\n                      \n                      \n                        40\n                        64\n                      \n                    \n\n                    but\n\n                    \n                      \n                        1\n                        9\n                      \n                      \n                        25\n                        49\n                      \n                    \n\n                    Atrapalhilton got to calculate the \u201csquare\u201d of the first, the second and the third matrices and realised that it was already too late, that he wouldn't be able to finish calculating the \u201csquares\u201d of all N matrices of the list. Hence, he decided to write a program which would do the job for him.","id":"1578","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":9048,"solved":1545,"ratio":"17.08%"}}
