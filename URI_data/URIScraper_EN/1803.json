It was developed by UNILA (Union of Nerds for Integration of Logic and Adventure) to keep messages safe from eavesdropping.\n\n\t\t\t\tThe first and last column of a matring keep the key to translate it to the real message. The remaining columns of a matring represent an ASCII-coded string, one column per character.\n\n\t\t\t\tFor a N-character long message, the corresponding matring is a 4x(N+2) matrix of digits. Each column is read as a 4-digit number; a top to bottom sequence of digits is the same as a left to right sequence in horizontal.\n\n\t\t\t\tLet the first number be F, the last number be L and the remaining ones to be a sequence of numbers Mi, where 1 ≤ i ≤ N. The first column of a matring is indexed as zero.\n\n\t\t\t\tTo decode a matring to an string, we must calculate: Ci = (F * Mi + L) mod 257, where Ci is the ASCII-coded character of the original message at position i.\n\n\t\t\t\tYour task is to develop an algorithm to decode matrings.","id":"1803","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":1309,"solved":878,"ratio":"67.07%"}}
