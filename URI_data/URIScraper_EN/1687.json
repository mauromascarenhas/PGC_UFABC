{"output":"For each test case, you should print a single line containing the number of possible unlock patterns. As this number can get large, print it modulo 1300031.","input":"The input consists of several test cases. Each test contains two numbers in a single line: N (2 ≤ N ≤ 15) and P (1 ≤ P ≤ 105). The last line of the input is 0 0, case that should not be processed.","level":9,"name":"Unlock the Smartphone","has_images":true,"description":"Henrique worked very hard during the last summer vacation helping his friends in math problems. He used the money he earned to buy a smartphone. He got really interested in the lock system of his phone.\n                    It has a NxN grid of points and he must draw a pattern that passes through exactly P points. Passing through the same point more than once is allowed, but such repetitions cannot be consecutive (a move that goes from and to the same point is not allowed). He can go from a certain point X to another point Y if the segment that connects X and Y does not cross any other point.\n\n                    \n\n                    Henrique worked really hard for his phone and wants to be sure that no one is going to find out his unlock pattern.He wants to know how many different unlock patterns exist.  \n                    Two patterns are considered the same if and only if both start at the same point and have the same sequence of movements.","id":"1687","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":279,"solved":113,"ratio":"40.50%"}}
