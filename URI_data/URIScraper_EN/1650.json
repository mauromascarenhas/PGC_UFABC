{"output":"For each test case, print the number of chess boards embedded within the given painting.","input":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case consists of one line with three integers n, m and c. (8 ≤ n, m ≤ 40000), where n is the number of rows of the painting, and m is the number of columns of the painting. c is always 0 or 1, where 0 indicates that the bottom right corner of the painting is black, and 1 indicates that this corner is white.\n\n                    The last test case is followed by a line containing three zeros.","level":3,"name":"Black and White Painting","has_images":false,"description":"You are visiting the Centre Pompidou which contains a lot of modern paintings. In particular you notice one painting which consists solely of black and white squares, arranged in rows and columns like in a chess board (no two adjacent squares have the same colour).\n\n                    Since you are bored, you wonder how many 8 × 8 chess boards are embedded within this painting. The bottom right corner of a chess board must always be white.","id":"1650","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":548,"solved":337,"ratio":"61.50%"}}
