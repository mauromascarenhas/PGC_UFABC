{"output":"For each case, your program should print an integer\n                    representing the number of times KiloMan is hit.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of\n                    input contain an integer N that indicates the\n                    number of test cases.  Each test case is composed by three lines and starts with a line\n                    containing the number of shots S (1 ≤ S ≤ 50). \n                    The second line contains S integers, \n                    that represent the pattern of heights at which the\n                    shots are being fired. Each element of pattern will be between\n                    1 and 7, inclusive. The third line of input contains the string\n                    'jumps', that represents the sequence of jumps that KiloMan\n                    will attempt; 'J' means he will jump and 'S' means he will\n                    stand still. For example, if the first number of the pattern is\n                    3 and the first character of jumps is 'J', then KiloMan will\n                    jump right as a shot is fired at height 3 (and thus he will be\n                    hit).","level":1,"name":"KiloMan","has_images":false,"description":"You've reached one of the last bosses in the new hit 2-D\n                    side-scrolling action game, KiloMan. The boss has a large gun\n                    that can shoot projectiles at various heights. For each shot,\n                    KiloMan can either stand still or jump. If he stands still and\n                    the shot is at height 1 or 2, then he gets hit.  If he jumps\n                    and the shot is at a height above 2, then he is also hit.\n                    Otherwise, he is not hit.
