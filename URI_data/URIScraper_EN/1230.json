{"output":"For each test case, determine whether there is a value assignment to f(x) for each integral point x ∈ [n] \\ S such that f(x)dx = y, i.e. the area under f(x) between the ends 0 and n is equal to y. If not, your program should print a line containing only the character \u2018N\u2019. If the assignments are possible, your program should print a line containing the character \u2018S\u2019, followed by values of f(x) for the integral points x in [n] \\ S, in increasing order of the values of x. The initial character and following values, if any, should be separated by a blank space. If more than one solution is possible, then print the lexicographically smallest solution.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The ﬁrst line of a test case contains three integers, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 106), M and Y (0 ≤ Y ≤ 109), respectively the amplitude of the interval, the size of S and the value of y. Each of the following M lines describes function f at a point of S, containing two integers  X (0 ≤ X ≤ N, ∀X ∈ S) and F (0 ≤ F ≤ 106), representing f(X) = F.  The values of X are not necessarily in ascending order.\n                    Note.:   f(x)dx ≤ 109 for any assignment of values to f(x) para x ∈ [n] \\ S satisfying the stated constraints.","level":10,"name":"Integral","has_images":true,"description":"Given a positive integer n, denote by [n] the real interval {x : 0 ≤ x ≤ n}. A function f : [n] ⇒ R.  Values of f  are provided on a subset S of [n], thereby partially specifying f.\n                    The set S satisﬁes the following properties:\n                    1. The points in S are all integers.\n                    2. The extremes 0 and n of [n] are both in S.\n                    The function f satisﬁes the following properties:\n        \n                    1. The values of f in the integral points of [n] are integers.\n                    2. For every integral point x in [n] \\ S (ie, the integral points of [n] are not in S), the function f is monotonic in the interval [x − 1, x + 1]. In other words, at least one of the inequalities f(x − 1) ≤ f(x) ≤ f(x + 1) and f(x − 1) ≥ f(x) ≥ f(x + 1) is satisﬁed.\n                    3. For each non-integral point x in [n], the value of f(x) is given by the linear interpolation of f(⌊x⌋) and f(⌈x⌉), ie, f(x) = (x − ⌊x⌋)f(⌊x⌋) + (⌈x⌉ − x)f(⌈x⌉).\n                    We still have the freedom of specifying the values of f in the integral points of [n] \\ S (note however that S can contain all the integral points of [n]). We would like to use this ﬂexibility to make f(x)dx = y, i.e., the area under f(x) between the extremes 0 and n equal to y, a given value. Your problem then is to decide whether this is possible or not.","id":"1230","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":216,"solved":50,"ratio":"23.15%"}}
