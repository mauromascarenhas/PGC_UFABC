{"output":"For each test case, print a line containing \"Time 1\" (without quotes) if Team 1 is the winner of the playoff, \" Time 2\" (without quotes) if the Team 2 is the winner of the playoff and \"Penaltis\" (without quotes) if you can not identify the winner in conventional time.","input":"The first line of input gives the number of test cases N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100). Each test case consists of two scores: the outcome of match 1 and the outcome of the 2. The score is represented by the format M x V, where M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100) is the number of goals for principal team and V (1 ≤ V ≤ 100) is the number of goals for the visiting team. As for each test case there are 2 matches, consider that Team 1 is always the principal of the first match and the visitor of the second and vice versa for Team 2.","level":3,"name":"Libertadores","has_images":false,"description":"The Libertadores Cup is the main soccer competition among professional clubs of South America, organized by the South American Confederation of Soccer (CONMEBOL).
