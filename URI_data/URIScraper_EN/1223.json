The first line of a test case contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 103) indicating the number of flaps of the toy. The second line contains two integers L (1 ≤ L ≤ 103) and H (1 ≤ H ≤ 103), indicating respectively the distance between the rods and the height of the rods.

The highest flap \n                    (the first to be described) has an end connected to the left rod and the second highest flap \n                    (the second to be described) has one end connected to the right rod, and so forth.
