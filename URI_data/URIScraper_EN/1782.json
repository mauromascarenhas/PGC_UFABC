{"output":"For each test case print \u201cCaso #X:\u201d, where X is the number of the current case, starting at 1, followed by the answers for each of the Q queries of this test case preceded by a single space.","input":"The first line of input contains an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 50), the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10\u2075), the number of nodes in Guga\u2019s graph. Each of the following N-1 lines contains three integers A (1 ≤ A ≤ N), B (1 ≤ B ≤ N) and C (1 ≤ C ≤ 10\u2076), indicating that there is an edge from node A to node B with weight C. The next line contains an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 10\u2074), the number of times that Guga and Andre will play. The following line contains Q integers Xi (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 10\u2076), the greatest weight allowed in the shortest path, as explained above.","level":9,"name":"Honorable Gift","has_images":false,"description":"Guga won a connected graph for his birthday, with N nodes and N-1 bidirectional edges. Each edge has a weight and connects two nodes. When Andre found out about Guga\u2019s gift, he came up with the following game: Given an integer X, how many pairs (A,B) (A ≤ B) exist such that all edges of the shortest path from node A to node B have weight less than or equal to X?\n\n                    Now Guga and Andre need a program to answer a lot of these questions, so they can play indefinitely and know whether they got the right answer.","id":"1782","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":219,"solved":66,"ratio":"30.14%"}}
