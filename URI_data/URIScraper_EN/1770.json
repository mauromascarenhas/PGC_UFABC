To do that you wrote an algorithm that would make a playlist with K songs of the album. The problem is that your algorithm is not very effective in the way the songs are chosen, in a way that some songs could be played more than once before other songs would be played for the first time.\n\n                    Given the number of songs of the album, the duration of each song, and the playlist generated by your algorithm, say how long it would take for you to listen to all the songs of the album at least once, if that is possible.","id":"1770","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":506,"solved":359,"ratio":"70.95%"}}
