The problem is that he did not simply put the correct name of the child in the present: he joked :) each of the names by mixing the letters in a sequence: two letters of the name followed by two letters of the surname, followed by two letters of the name and by two letters of the surname and so on.\n\nWell, as Noel is very tired this year and without time for jokes, he asked you that is an expert in programming to make a program that converts the name mixed by Evergreen into the correct name of each child.\n Just a curiousity: the first line of each test case will always have an even number of characters and the second line will always have the same number of characters of the first line (or the same number -1 character).","id":"2722","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":1532,"solved":613,"ratio":"40.01%"}}
