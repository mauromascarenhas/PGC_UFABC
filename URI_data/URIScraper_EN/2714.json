{"output":"The valid outputs for the program are: the presentation of the provisional password or the indication of \"INVALID DATA\". The temporary password is made up of the X numeric characters not started at 0 to the right of the string, for example: for the identifier \"RA000000000000012340\" the temporary password must be \"12340\". If the received string does not conform to the training rules, the program should indicate \"INVALID DATA\".","input":"The first entry line is an integer value N (1 <= N <= 1000) that represents the amount of RA's that the program must account for.

In this institution RA's are 20-character strings always initialized by the characters \"RA\" and followed by 18 numeric digits. for example: RA000000000000012340. These identifiers are automatically generated by the registration system and are formed by three main parts: (a) initialized by the characters \"RA\", (b) followed by Z zeros which are position formatters (where, 0 <= Z <= 17 ), and finally, (c) the student's own identification number, considering the X numbers to the right of the RA not initiated by zero (where, 1 <= X <= 18).","id":"2714","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":907,"solved":522,"ratio":"57.55%"}}
