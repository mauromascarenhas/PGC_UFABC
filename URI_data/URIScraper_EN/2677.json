{"output":"For each entry case, on the output will be printed on a single line the number of even numbers that the first player will get if both players play for the best success.","input":"The input has several test cases, each test case occupy two lines, the first line has an odd number N, 0 < N < 500, in the second line, 2N integers, where N is even and N is odd, in any arrangement, each value is in the interval [0..10000]. The test cases end with N = 0.","level":8,"name":"Even or Odd","has_images":false,"description":"The game, for two people, has a sequence with N even numbers and N odd values, N being itself an odd number. This sequence is arranged randomly. Each round a player chooses a number from one of the extremities. In the end, anyone with the most even numbers wins. For example, consider the following arrangement (with three odd and even pairs):\r\n\r\n4 1 8 11 2 7\r\n\r\nThe first player wins getting all three even numbers for himself. On the other hand, for the following sequency:\r\n\r\n5 8 4 7 6 3\r\n\r\nThe first player, considering that both play for the best success, will win with only 2 even numbers. Always wanting the best result, the inventor of the game asked you to make a program that already predicted with how many even numbers, the first player wins, considering that both play for the best success.","id":"2677","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":935,"solved":207,"ratio":"22.14%"}}
