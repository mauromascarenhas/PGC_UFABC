{"output":"For each test case print a number -- the maximum number of critical points that can be included in a curve drawn from the given points.","input":"There will be no more than 222 test cases. Each test case starts with an integer N, the number of points in the test case. In the next N lines, there will be N pair of integers giving the x and y coordinate of the points. There will be no more than 1000 points in each test case. All coordinates are integers -- they'd fit in a signed 2 byte integer data type. The data must be read of default input.","level":8,"name":"Critical Wave","has_images":true,"description":"The task is simple. Through some critical points in 2D, you have to draw a wave like curve. Your goal is to include as many points as possible.\n\n\t\n\t\tThere will be an imaginary line  y = a, which we call the major axis for the curve.\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tAll the points on the curve should have different x coordinates.
