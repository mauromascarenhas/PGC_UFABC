He hates exponentiation and for some reason does not correctly calculate operations involving the number 7. Knowing this, his friend Caco decided to make a challenge: he wants Chagas to calculate the Nth power of 7 and say the last digit of that power. If Chagas hit all The questions, I would get 7 boiled eggs. For example, where N = 2, the result would be 9, because 72 = 49. The problem is that, depending on the value of N, the result of exponentiation can be a very large number. Without ideas, Chagas decided to ask for his help.\n\n            Write a program that, given a number, calculate the last digit of the value of 7 raised to that number.","id":"2590","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":3235,"solved":990,"ratio":"30.60%"}}
