{"output":"The output is the minimum number of triangles necessary to compose an N-sided regular polygon.","input":"The input is a single number N (3 ≤ N ≤ 109), indicating the number of sides of a regular polygon.","level":1,"name":"Triangles and Regular Polygons","has_images":true,"description":"Professor Rafael loves Computer Graphics. Its favourite activity is rendering objects, specially dolls. But he does not like to draw regular polygons using triangles. This task is done by composing a regular polygon using only triangles, in such a way that the triangles do not intercept each other and the minimum number of them are used in this composition. In the picture below you can see a square and a pentagon with its triangles.\n\n\n\nProfessor Rafael asked you to calculate the minimum number of triangles necessary to compose a N-sided regular polygon.","id":"2058","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":2409,"solved":1962,"ratio":"81.44%"}}
