The intersection of these two highways is popularly known as Trevo de Irani (literally \u2018Irani's Clover\u2019, for, in Brazilian Portuguese, the same word used for clovers, \u2018trevo\u2019, is used for simple highway intersections), because it is located in the city of Irani, or Trevo da Fênix (literally \u2018Phoenix's Clover\u2019), because its shape, when viewed from above, reminds the mythical creature phoenix, as shows the Figure. The region of the state in which is located the Trevo da Fênix is called Vale do Contestado (literally \u2018Valley of the Contested\u2019), because it was in this region that happened one of the most important civil wars of Brazilian history: the Guerra do Contestado (literally \u2018War of the Contested\u2019), between rebels of the people known as caboclos, under the notorious leadership of the monk José Maria among others, and federal troops of Brazilian Army, under the notorious leadership of the Col. João Gualberto among others.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is said that, once, a group of rebels was running desperate from the Army troops and happened to come to the Trevo da Fênix. Frustrated with the battle they had lost that day, one of them kicked the dust of the ground. The wind lifted the dust, which in fact was not dust, but ashes, and for a moment the caboclos saw a phoenix, that gave them an Order: \u201cMorse!\u201d. Back to the camp on the next day and having told the story to the monk José Maria, the caboclos started to study the Morse Code, to intercept messages from the Col. João Gualberto's troops and to try to identify repeated patterns in those messages.","id":"1842","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":295,"solved":104,"ratio":"35.25%"}}
