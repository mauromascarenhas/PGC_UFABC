{"output":"Print a single integer, the maximum number of chocolate candies that chocolate Tapioca can eat.","input":"The first line of the input will contain an integer 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000, that is the amount of chocolate candies that will fall from the sky. Each of the next n lines will contain three integers, 0 ≤ xi, yi ≤ 20 e 0 ≤ ti ≤ 1000, the coordinates and the moment of the fall of the i-chocolate candy.","level":9,"name":"Tapioca and The Chocolate Rain","has_images":false,"description":"Tapioca dreamed that it was raining chocolate in the city that he lives, Lagoa de Roça (There already rained hail, but this is a fact for another problem). Chocolate of various types, it\u2019s just sad that he can\u2019t eat all the chocolate, because the chocholate that falls on the ground is completely lost. But he can try to get the maximum amount of chocholate before it falls on the ground. Fortunately, in this dream Tapioca can predict the future, he knows the moment and the position that each chocolate will fall. However, he can\u2019t do two things in the same time and so your help is needed. Write a program that with the predictions of Tapioca, report the maximum amount of chocolate candies that he can eat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tConsider Lagoa de Roça as a plane and that Tapioca is in the moment 0 in the position (6, 6). Besides, he just can move for orthogonal positions, in other words, North, South, East and West. To move he spends one second and he can get a candy, if and only if, he is in the same position and at the moment when it will fall.","id":"1927","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":1151,"solved":325,"ratio":"28.24%"}}
