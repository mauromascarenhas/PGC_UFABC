The players of this game are divided in three teams: Team Valor, Team Instinct and Team Mystic, which are led by their leaders, Kandera, Esparky and Blanque, respectively. Of course, you belong to one of these teams!\r\n\r\nThe leader of your team is being accused of cheating by incorrectly managing the candies the team receives from the Professor. This fact created a big controversy among the players in the team: some players state that the leader really cheated, must suffer an impeachment and must leave his position as a leader, while other players state that he did not cheat, that the accusation is false and he must keep leading the team.\r\n\r\nTo solve this situation, a poll will be held with all N players in your team. Each player must vote if the impeachment must or must not occur. If the number of votes for the impeachment is greater than or equal to 2/3 (two thirds) of the total number of players in the team, the leader will lost his position. Otherwise, the accusation will be filed and he will keep leading the team.\r\n\r\nGiven the votes of all players, determine the result of the poll.","id":"2540","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":3146,"solved":1565,"ratio":"49.75%"}}
