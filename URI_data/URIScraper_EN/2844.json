After many years of mourning, they came to the conclusion that the duel is not always won by the one who only types faster, as other factors influence the winner. As each participates in their own home, they have a certain delay to receive and send data from the server. They also have a different reaction time, which can cause some of them to type in later. And of course, each one has its typing speed.\nGiven the delay regarding the connection of each one, its reaction time, and the speed of writing, who will be the winner?","id":"2844","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":298,"solved":169,"ratio":"56.71%"}}
