Tracing Movements","has_images":true,"description":"Do you remember the railway station of PopPush City? If you don\u2019t know \nabout or only to remember, exist a railway station in an incredible hilly country.\n In addition, the station was built in last century and\n unfortunately, funds were extremely limited that time. It was possible \nto establish only a surface track. Moreover, it turned out that the \nstation could be only a dead-end one (see picture) and due to lack of \navailable space it could have only one track.\n\n\n\t\n\n\tEvery wagon arriving from the direction A continues in the direction B,\n reorganized in some way at the station. You can assume that every \nsingle wagon can be disconnected from the train before it enter the \nstation and that they can move themselves until they are on the track in\n the direction B to be connected in the other locomotive. You can also \nsuppose that at any time there can be located as many wagons as \nnecessary in the station. But once a wagon has entered the station it \ncannot return to the track in the direction A and also once it has left \nthe station in the direction B it cannot return back to the station.\n\n\n\tAll the wagons are identified by letters from a to z,\n all in lowercase. This means 26 wagons, at the maximum. The chief for \ntrain reorganizations must know what sequence of movements is needed to \nachieve a desired output order to continue going from station to B \ndirection. The movements into the station and out of the station are described by the \nletters I and R (Insert and Remove \nrespectely). Using the figure example, the input e,t,d,a and the desired\n output d,a,t,e, result in the movements I,I,I,R,I,R,R,R","id":"1063","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":5835,"solved":2062,"ratio":"35.34%"}}
