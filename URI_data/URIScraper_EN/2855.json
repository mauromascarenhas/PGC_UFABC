{"output":"Print \"N\" if the tested number is not a lucky number and \"Y\" otherwise. Break a line after each test case.","input":"The input is composed by several test cases. Each test case is composed by an integer N(0<N<305000) that determines how many numbers there are in the sequence. After this follows N integers Ni(0<Ni<305000) in ascending order. Finally, an integer M(0<M<305000) which represents the sequence digit to be tested.","level":9,"name":"Lucky Numbers","has_images":false,"description":"A lucky number is a number in a given sequence that survives the following exclusion process: Initially every second element is deleted. After that, every third element is deleted and so on until the number in question is in a lower position than the next index to be deleted.\n\nFor example, in the sequence [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 ...] we would like to know if the numbers 7 and 9 are lucky. After the first pass we will have [1,3,5,7,9,11,13 ...], after the second pass we will have [1,3,7,9,13 ...]. After the fourth pass [1,3,7,13...]. Thus we can conclude that the number 7 is lucky and that the number 9 is an unlucky number in this sequence.\n\nAlfredo enjoyed the game but is tired of erasing and rewriting each sequence to find out what the lucky numbers are. Can you write a program to determine if given number in a sequence is a lucky number?","id":"2855","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":1679,"solved":245,"ratio":"14.59%"}}
