{"output":"For each operation type 3 or 4, its program should produce a line containing the value of the corresponding response. If a row or column have two or more values that are repeated the same number of times, you must print as many of them. For example, if a line has the values [5,7,7,2,5,2,1,3], both the 2, 5 and 7 are repeated twice, then the answer is 7 because it is the largest of the array.","input":"The first input line consists of two integers N and Q (1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 105) representing, respectively, the tray size and the number of operations. The next Q input lines will contain the Q operations. The entire first line of each will indicate the type of operation. If 1 or 2 is followed by two integer X (1 ≤ X ≤ N) and R (0 ≤ R ≤ 50). If 3 or 4, will be followed by one further integer X.","level":10,"name":"Frequency","has_images":false,"description":"Byteland is a city well known for proposing varied challenges to its inhabitants. Recently, the mayor of Byteland, Joãozinho decided to propose a challenge he likes to call the Board of Frequency.\r\n\r\nThe game is as follows. Initially, a tray with dimensions N × N is data containing only 0's. Thereafter, Q operations are proposed, which can be of 4 types:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t1 X R: Assign the R value to all numbers in the X line;\r\n\t2 X R: Assign the R value to all numbers in the X column;\r\n\t3 X: Print the most common value in the X line;\r\n\t4 X: Print the most common value in column X.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoãozinho is very good with computers, but also quite lazy. Knowing that you are one of the best programmers in the world, he decided to ask for your help to solve this problem.","id":"2467","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":171,"solved":45,"ratio":"26.32%"}}
