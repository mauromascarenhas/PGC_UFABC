{"output":"Your program should show who will be the new godofor.","input":"he first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100) representing how many creatures have signed up to try to be the new godofor. Each of the following N lines contains a string S (1 ≤ |S| ≤ 100) representing the name of the creature, followed by three integers P (1 ≤ P ≤ 100),K (1 ≤ K ≤ 100), M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100) representing respectively the power of the cretature, how many gods he has already killed, and how many times he has already died. The string is composed of uppercase and lowercase letters.","level":5,"name":"Godofor","has_images":false,"description":"After the death of Ares, the last godofor, the other gods decided to make a contest to decide who will be new godofor. But creatures of various universes had an interest in the place. Because there are so many candidates, is very hard to the gods select one of them, so they decided to resort to you, the god of programming, they want you to develop a program that decides who will be the new godofor based on the criteria defined by the gods.\n\n\nCandidates will be evaluated based on three attributes, candidate's power level, how many gods the candidate has already killed and how many times the candidate has already died. The godofor must be the most powerful candidate, in the case of a tie, it must be the candidate who killed more gods, if a tie occurs again, the chosen one will be the candidate who died the least, if even the tie persists, the godofor will be the candidate with the lowest name Lexicographically.","id":"2654","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":954,"solved":323,"ratio":"33.86%"}}
