Routers transmit data to each other through the internet cables, the transmitted data can travel by one or more routes for reach the receiver.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe price of network cables used in the company's routers can be very expensive, and the company needs to save money. Thinking about that, the company decided to make some changes in the network infrastructure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBruno must modify the network infrastructure and make sure that all routers are able to transmit data to each other and there is only one route between each pair of routers, saving as much as possible of internet cables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYou have to find out the total cost with cables that the company will have after the changes made by Bruno. The figure below shows (a) the current infrastructure networks; and (b) the infrastructure networks after the change.","id":"1774","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":2717,"solved":1308,"ratio":"48.14%"}}
