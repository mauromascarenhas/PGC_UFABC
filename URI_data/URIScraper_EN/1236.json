As the files contain basically white spaces and zeros (0), this program must be something very simple. The text contains only uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces and numbers. You must to consider the $ like a symbol for compression of spaces and the symbol # like a symbol to compress zeros. Remember 2 details:\n\n\t\n\t\tYou must print the AscII char corresponding to the frequence, not the decimal number.\n\t\n\t\tIf occurs more than 255 null or white chars, the output must be done in two or more parts, because the maximum size of a byte is 255. For example, to compress 380 successive '0' chars, the first block will compress the first 255 occurrences and the second one will compress the 125 remaining, and so on. The result in this case would be \"# #}\". Note that the 255 char is invisible (seems like a space). \n\n\n\tTo understand a little more, consider the following ASCII table: for example, CHR(3) means \u201cETX\u201d\n\n\t\n\t\n        Note:\n    \n\tDo not compress when only 2 repeated zeros or blank spaces occurs(\"*00*\" ou \"*  *\"), because this compression will not result in any space optimization.\n\tOur toolkit may not print some special chars needed in the output of this problem.","id":"1236","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":2030,"solved":498,"ratio":"24.53%"}}
