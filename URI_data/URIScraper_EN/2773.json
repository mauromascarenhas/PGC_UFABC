It is known that he walks at a speed of V meters per second and that there is a vacant lot between his house and his school that can not be used to cut way. Knowing this, what is the least time, in seconds, for Joãozinho to complete the journey? Consider the situation in the 2D plane, where Joãozinhos's house is at the point (Xi, Yi), the school at point (Xf, Yf), the lower left point on the terrain at point (X1, Y1), and the upper right at point (Xr, Yr). The terrain has its sides parallel to the X and Y axes and it is guaranteed that Xi < Xl, Xr < Xf, Yl \\(\\leq\\) Yi, Yf \\(\\leq\\) Yr, that is, Joãozinho's house is to the left of the terrain, the school to the right, and Joãozinho will need to get around part of the land to get to school.","id":"2773","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":206,"solved":82,"ratio":"39.81%"}}
