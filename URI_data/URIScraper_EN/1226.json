Thus, they do not use the fourth floor or the floor 13 or the floor 134 nor the floor 113, but use the floor 103. Thus, the first floors are numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, . . .\n\t\n\tAs the space elevator has many levels, and levels must be numbered, the Chinese asked you to write a program that, given the level, indicates which number should be assigned to it.","id":"1226","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":1000,"solved":291,"ratio":"29.10%"}}
