Usually in these camps, students are divided into collective chalets  by gender and age, always with a supervisor or supervisor who, in addition to sleep ing in the cottage with the group, are also responsible for creating and executing several interesting and exciting activities for all ages. Among the many activities we can do mention of  games, excursions, Gymkhana Musical, Night competitions, etc.. On the first day of camp due to heavy rain, recreational activities were limited and the children were taken to the gymnasium. We conducted a contest and one of the activities consisted of the same group children in a circle (arranged in a counterclockwise direction) which would be removed one by one until only one child was left, which would be the winner. \n\t\n\t\t At the moment the child enters the circle it receives a small token containing a number between 1 and 500. Once the circle is formed, it is counted up to the number corresponding to the token the first child holds, beginning from the child besides him or her. The child where the  counting ends, should be removed from the group. The count starts again according to the number in the token the child who has just been eliminated. In order to make the game more interesting, when the number in the token is even, the counting is done clockwise, otherwise the counting is done in a counterclockwise direction. \n\t\n\t The play was very successful and the administrator of the camp asked you to develop a program for the next event, to allow him to knows in advance which child will be the winner of each group, based on the information provided.","id":"1167","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":3879,"solved":1266,"ratio":"32.64%"}}
