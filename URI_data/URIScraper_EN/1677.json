{"output":"For each test case output the bottom of the specified graph on a single line. To this end, print the numbers of all nodes that are sinks in sorted order separated by a single space character. If the bottom is empty, print an empty line.","input":"The input contains several test cases, each of which corresponds to a directed graph G. Each test case starts with an integer number v, denoting the number of vertices of G = (V, E), where the vertices will be identified by the integer numbers in the set V = {1,...,v}. You may assume that v(1 ≤ v ≤ 5000). That is followed by a non-negative integer e and, thereafter, e pairs of vertex identifiers v1W1,...,veWe with the meaning that (vi,Wi) ∈ E. There are no edges other than specified by these pairs. The last test case is followed by a zero.","level":9,"name":"The Bottom of a Graph","has_images":true,"description":"We will use the following standard definitions from graph theory. Let V be a nonempty and finite set, its elements being called vertices (or nodes). Let E be a subset of the Cartesian product V×V, its elements being called edges. Then G = (V, E) is called a directed graph.\n\n                    Let N be a positive integer, and let P = (e1,...,en) be a sequence of length N of edges, ei ∈ E such that ei = (vi ,vi+1) for a sequence of vertices (v1,...,vn+1). Then P is called a path from vertex v1 to vertex vn+1 in G and we say that vn+1 is reachable from v1, writing (v1→vn+1).\n\n                    Here are some new definitions. A node V in a graph G = (V, E) is called a sink, if for every node W in G that is reachable from v, v is also reachable from W. The bottom of a graph is the subset of all nodes that are sinks, i.e., bottom(G) = {v ∈ V|∀w ∈ V:(v→W) ⇒ (W→v)}. You have to calculate the bottom of certain graphs.","id":"1677","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":653,"solved":152,"ratio":"23.28%"}}
