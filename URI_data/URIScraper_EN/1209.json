Groups of punks, hardcore bands and several other representatives of the alternative scene moved to the city, attracted by the large amount of young people. With the emergence of virtual communities, a few years later, it was noted the enormous potential of using these communities to combine meetings, parties, raves, etc..\n\n\tIn these celebrations of St. Petersburg is always very important that each participant has at least a certain number of friends on the social network. At the same time, we want to invite as many people as possible to St. Petersburg since the restriction on the number of friends is satisfied. This constraint says that, to be invited to the party, the person must have at least one number K of friends on the guest list.\n\n\tYour task in this problem is, given the number of people in the community and to list their relationships, determine what should be called to the party that has the largest possible number of participants satisfying the constraint.","id":"1209","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":2662,"solved":555,"ratio":"20.85%"}}
