{"output":"For each test case, your program shall output a line containing a value with 3 decimal places with represents the minimal difference between ΣLEFT and ΣRIGHT.","input":"Many test cases make up the input. The first line of each test case contains a single positive integer N (4 ≤ N ≤ 100), which represents the number of cherries in the cake. Follow then N lines, each consisting of two integers X and Y (-50 ≤ X, Y ≤ 50, X2 + Y2 ≤ 502), which represent the coordinates, in centimetres, of the cherries in the cake, considering that the centre of the cake is placed at the origin of the cartesian plane. The input ends with N = 0.","level":4,"name":"Bobby's Amazing Cake","has_images":true,"description":"Bobby is very happy, afterall he's got an amazing round birthday cake, with 1 metre of diametre, adorned with many cherries. In order to make easier the distribution of the pieces among his beloved ones, Bobby wishes initially to split the cake in two following a straight line. Though the line does not need to intercept the centre of the cake, it needs to intercept at least two cherries. Besides, let ΣLEFT be the sum, for all cherries to the left of the line, of the distance from each cherry to the line, and let ΣRIGHT be the sum, for all cherries to the right of the line, of the distance from each cherry to the line, then Bobby wishes the difference between ΣLEFT and ΣRIGHT to be as least as possible, as shown in Figure, in which the cherries are represented by points. Nevertheless, one may consider that cherries intercepted by the cut are neither to the left nor to the right of the line, and that the diametre of the cherries is negligible.","id":"1631","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":462,"solved":268,"ratio":"58.01%"}}
