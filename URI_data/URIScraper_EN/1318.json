{"output":"For each test case your program should print one line, containing the number of tickets in the pack that had another ticket with the same sequence number.","input":"The input contains data for several test cases. Each test case has two lines. The first line contains two integers N and M which indicate respectively the number of original tickets and the number of persons attending the party (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000 and 1 ≤ M ≤ 20000). The second line of a test case contains M integers Ti, representing the ticket numbers in the pack the director gave you (1 ≤ Ti ≤ N). the end of input is indicated by (N = M = 0).","level":4,"name":"Fake Tickets","has_images":false,"description":"Your school organized a big party to celebrate your team brilliant win in the prestigious, world-famous ICPC (International Collegiate Poetry Contest).
