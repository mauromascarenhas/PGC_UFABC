In case of a tie, the lowest index participant passes. He is declared winner of a duel, the one that can enter a certain phrase faster, that is, the one that obtains the less time resulting from its reaction time added to the time necessary to enter the phrase of that round. In each phase also, the text used will be the previous one concatenated with itself.\nGiven each competitor's information, please tell us which stage each will reach.","id":"2843","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":282,"solved":61,"ratio":"21.63%"}}
