In this game, he selects a string containing lowercase letters and asterisks and the objective is to change all asterisks in order to transform the string into a palindrome *. However, this game is very easy for Dabriel and he is proposing a simple modification.\n\nYou will receive the string with lowercase letters and asterisks and a set of index pairs. With this, you must inform how many different ways there are to transform this string into a palindrome, if possible, being able to replace only the asterisks and leaving all pairs of indexes with the same letter.\n\nFor the string a**a and containing only one index pair = {1, 3}, there is only one way to\n\tgenerate the palindrome respecting all the rules, being:  aaaa.","id":"2816","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":157,"solved":36,"ratio":"22.93%"}}
