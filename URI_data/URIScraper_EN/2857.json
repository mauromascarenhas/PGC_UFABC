To generate satisfactory data, employees need to know at certain times how many different people are within two ranges of wagons.\n\nThey need your help and all they gave you was a spreadsheet with the number N of wagons (from 1 to  N from left to right), and the M activities that occurred on the day. The activities can be type 1 or type 2:\n\n1 X Y - Means that  Y people got into the X wagon.\n2 A B C D - It means that they want to know the number of different people in the wagons of the intervals  [A, B] and [C, D].\n\nConsider that initially all wagons are empty.\n\nFollows an illustration of the wagons at one point:\n\n\n\nIf there is an activity of type 2 with (A=2, B=4, C=3, D=5),  the answer will be 8, since there are 8 distinct people in these two intervals.","id":"2857","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":295,"solved":116,"ratio":"39.32%"}}
