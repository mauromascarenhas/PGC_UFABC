Willing to help (or not really), professors decided the assignments will be done in pairs and they would also inform what is the degree of difficulty of each assignment.\r\n\r\nConsidering that, Rangel, our old friend, chose Gugu as his partner, knowing how responsible he is. Keeping in mind that both are really busy they decided to split their assignments according to the following criteria:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    The sequence in which each assignment is done can be changed during the splitting;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    The splitting needs to be fair, therefore, minimizing the difference among the assignments done by Rangel and Gugu.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nBecause both of them are really busy at the library getting the books to work on their assignments, they asked you to determine the difference.","id":"2716","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":1205,"solved":330,"ratio":"27.39%"}}
