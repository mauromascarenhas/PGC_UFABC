{"output":"You should output the corresponding Maja coordinates to Willi's numbers, each coordinate pair on a separate line.","input":"The input file contains one or more integers which represent Willi's numbers. Each number stands on its own in a separate line, directly followed by a newline.

This bee hive consists of many hexagonal honey combs where the honey is stored in. But bee Maja has a problem. Willi told her where she can meet him, but because Willi is a male drone and Maja is a female worker they have different coordinate systems.\r\n\r\n                    Maja's Coordinate System\r\n\r\n                    Maja who often flies directly to a special honey comb has laid an advanced two dimensional grid over the whole hive.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    Willi's Coordinate System\r\n\r\n                    Willi who is more lazy and often walks around just numbered the cells clockwise starting from 1 in the middle of the hive.\r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n                    Help Maja to convert Willi's system to hers.
