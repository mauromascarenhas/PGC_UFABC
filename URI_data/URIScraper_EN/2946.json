{"output":"Print out all the numbers that divide N from the list given by Dabriel (as he is a little inattentive there may be duplicates in his list, so print out all), separated by a space, ordered in ascending order. If no number exists, print: \"Nenhum\", without quotation marks.","input":"The first line contains a number in binary N (1 ≤ |N| ≤ 105). In the second line contains an integer M (1 ≤ M ≤ 10), which represents how many numbers one wants to know the divisibility. In the next M lines, it will have an integer Mi (1 ≤ Mi ≤ 105), where Mi is the number Dabriel wants to know if it divides N.","level":5,"name":"Dabriel and the Divisibility","has_images":false,"description":"Dabriel loves to play with numbers and this time has a very interesting game. It has a binary number N and a list with M numbers and you want to know for which numbers Mi from that list N is divisible.\nThis task is very easy for him, so you will not waste time doing this, can you help him?","id":"2946","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":532,"solved":111,"ratio":"20.86%"}}
