{"output":"For each test case, print the value of h such that all cups must be filled up to the height h cm. Print the answer with 2 decimal places.","input":"The first line of input contains an integer C that determines the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing two integers, N and L (1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ L ≤ 108), the number of friends in the group and the amount of Coke in the bottle, in milliliters. The second line contains three integers b, B and H (1 ≤ b ≤ B ≤ 100, 1 ≤ H ≤ 100), the radii of the smaller and the larger base, and the height of the cups, in centimeters.","level":4,"name":"Splitting the Coke","has_images":true,"description":"A group of N friends went to a restaurant to have lunch. Although each person decided to order a different dish, they all decided to drink Coke. The group ordered a Coke bottle with L ml, and must now split the content of the bottle between the N people in such a way that each person gets the same amount of the drink.\n\nFor each person, there is an empty cup which must be filled with the drink that person will receive. All N cups are equal, and can be described as cone frustum whose height is H cm, the smaller base has a radius equal to b cm, and the larger base has a radius equal to B cm, as indicated by the figure.\n\n\nCups filled with Coke up to the height h cm\n\nYour task is to help the group to split the Coke bottle. You must find the height h such that, if each cup is filled with Coke up to the height h cm, then each person gets the same amount of the drink. You may assume that no cup will needed to be filled more than its capacity.","id":"1549","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":1695,"solved":579,"ratio":"34.16%"}}
