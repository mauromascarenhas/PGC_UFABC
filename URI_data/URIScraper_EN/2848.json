The next line contains N integers Xi (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 232-1) which are the elements of the array. The next Q lines contain five integers L and R(1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N) representing the extremes of the round interval, K which is the smaller Kth element drawn (Kth will always exist), G and D (1 ≤ G, D ≤ 232-1) the guess of Gugu and Dabriel respectively.","level":4,"name":"Rangel and the Array Game I","has_images":false,"description":"Always after the programming competitions the participants usually interact. Thinking about it, Rangel is developing an interesting game for the participants to play after a competition. This game will be known as the Array  Game.\nThe Array Game works as follows:\n\n\n\tA array with N integers is generated randomly and shown for 10 seconds for the challengers.\n\tThen follows Q rounds where players must say how many times the Kth smaller element appears in a given range.\n\tWin the round closest to the result.\n\n\nThis year Rangel called his friends Gugu and Dabriel to test the new game and asked you to design the judge to say who Kth is their frequency in the break and who wins the ith round.","id":"2848","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":102,"solved":50,"ratio":"49.02%"}}
