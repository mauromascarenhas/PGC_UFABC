{"output":"Output the pigeon route. The symbol '*' denotes the moment that the pigeon is reached and the symbol '!' denotes the moment that it is captured. If it gets out of the squadron's action area, print: \"Raios! Raios Duplos! Raios Triplos!\". There's no blank space only after the last character of the last row of the matrix, which should be justified.","input":"The input consists of several test cases. Each test case contains the squadron's action area (25 â‰¤ A < 106), that is, always a perfect square, then the moment in which the speed turbo is activated. Read input until EOF.\n\nThe pigeon's flight and the squadron's flight are spiral and always start from the central element, which is the number 1.","level":9,"name":"Stop the Pigeon!","has_images":true,"description":"The Vulture Squadron is just sick of trying to catch the pigeon Doodle. As a result, Dick Dastardly has elaborated an infallible hunting plan, at least in his thoughts.\n\n\n\nEvery time they activate the speed turbo in their flying machines, they can reach the pigeon by flying a distance greater than what they have already flown and they can finally catch it when they fly half the distance of where they already are.\n\nHowever, if the pigeon flies out of the squadron's action area and, as a result of that, doesn't get caught, Dick Dastardly gets angry and mumbles: \"Raios! Raios Duplos! Raios Triplos\", which means \"Drat! Double Drat! Triple Drat!\".","id":"2142","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":205,"solved":59,"ratio":"28.78%"}}
