The family life of the queen of Egypt forced her to take care of several things, including the menu of the court. Akhenaton was known to dislike the repeated food, and even at regular intervals. He wished that the menus were not only different, but practically impossible to find out when a course is repeated. This created a huge problem for cooks of King, Nefertiti took an idea. Prepared a list of N dishes, which would be repeated. It was a requirement that the difference between the dish prepared in the i-th day was in module, smaller than a certain K given. Such a requirement, besides being for religious reasons, because of the obligations of the Ra Egyptian, was also due to the fact that the ingredients of the dish were achieved in this range, and were also subject to expire for consumption. Your task in this program is to determine, given an integer N (number of different dishes) and an integer K, representing the many different schedules (which are actually permutations π of {1, 2, ..., n}) satisfying the constraint below:\n\n                    |π(i) - i| ≤ K, para i = 1,...,N.","id":"2074","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":38,"solved":17,"ratio":"44.74%"}}
