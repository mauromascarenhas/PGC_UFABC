Usually the flight attendants push carts containing the meals down along the aisles of the plane. When a cart reaches your row, you are asked right away: \u201cChicken, beef, or pasta?\u201d You know your choices, but you have only a few seconds to choose and you don\u2019t know how your choice will look like because your neighbor hasn\u2019t opened his wrap yet. . .\r\n\r\nThe flight attendant in this flight decided to change the procedure. First she will ask all passengers what choice of meal they would prefer, and then she will check if the number of meals available in this flight for each choice are enough.\r\n\r\nAs an example, consider that the available number of meals for chicken, beef and pasta are respectively (80, 20, 40), while the number of passenger\u2019s choices for chicken, beef and pasta are respectively (45, 23, 48). In this case, eleven people will surely not receive their selection for a meal, since three passengers who wanted beef and eight passengers who wanted pasta cannot be pleased.\r\n\r\nGiven the quantity of meals available for each choice and the number of meals requested for each choice, could you please help the flight attendant to determine how many passengers will surely not receive their selection for a meal?","id":"2702","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":3143,"solved":2122,"ratio":"67.52%"}}
