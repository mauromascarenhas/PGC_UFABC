Every year they welcome N freshmen that need to receive their credentials to access their system.\r\n\r\nEach student gets an username based on his full name. The username is generated by concatenating the first letters of each word of the name, and then attaching it to the year he entered the university. For example, if Fulado de Tal entered the university in 1998, his username will be fdt1998.\r\n\r\nProblems appear when more than one student must have the same username. In that case, one of the students gets an username according to the rules above, while the other ones get non-standard usernames, i.e., usernames that do not follow the rules above.\r\n\r\nMany freshmen entered the university this year. Vasya and Petya asked for your help to write a program that, given the full name of all freshmen and the current year, determine how many students will get non-standard usernames.","id":"2549","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":820,"solved":208,"ratio":"25.37%"}}
