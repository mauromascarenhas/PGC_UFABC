In this place, they use a special type of vine to use as Rabiola the kite. The vine is formed of a single strand formed by normal leaves and adherent sheets. In the examples, normal sheets are represented by a letter 'o' and the adherent sheets formed by a letter 'x'. To take advantage of the various colors of vines, each championship kite can just put a single tape. Each adhesive sheet to be stuck at a single point in the kite base. With this, normal leaves fillets are formed. The two outermost fillets are normally without folds. Internal fillets, always formed by an even number of leaves are bent: Below is an example of vine, and their placement in the kite:\r\n\r\nVine: ooxooooooxo\r\n\r\nAfter pasting the adhesive sheets, the Rabiola looks like this:\r\n\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\nFillets appear separated in the image for better viewing. In fact, the threads are superimposed. Its mission is to make an algorithm that, given a vine, enter the size of the largest Rabiola fillet done with it.","id":"1876","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":480,"solved":312,"ratio":"65.00%"}}
