{"output":"The more frequent token in the string S defining a token size of two (2) followed by the frequency number is printed. The token must be printed as lowercase.","input":"One input line composed of a string S representing the text, composed of printable characters and possibly ended by a EOL. The maximum length of the input line is \\(10^5\\) characters.","level":7,"name":"Tokens Frequency","has_images":false,"description":"A hospital aims at migrating the patient system to a new one. However, it is observed that the client table has a problem with the duplicate register. The same patient can be stored in the database in two different ways, i.e., \u201cKetlyn da Silva\u201d or \u201cKetlin da Silva\u201d.\n\nTo mitigate it,  the number of common tokens can be computed by splitting the string into segments (tokens) with defined size. For example, the tokens with size three for the string \u201cKetlyn\u201d are represented as: \u201cket\u201d,\u201detl\u201d, \u201dtly\u201d e \u201clyn\u201d; already the string \u201cKetlin\u201d  produces the tokens: \u201cket\u201d, \u201cetl\u201d, \u201ctli\u201d,\u201dlin\u201d. Observe that the token generation is produced by sliding windows approach, sliding one character at each time. Note that there is no distinction between lowercase and uppercase\ncharacters. In the end, the number of common tokens is computed.\n\nThe task here is to produce and identify the token with size two (2) more frequent in a given string. When to token frequency is equal, the first token in alphabetic order should be outputted.","id":"2827","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":373,"solved":116,"ratio":"31.10%"}}
