You are given the information that one vertex of the square will be coincident with a vertex of the square as shown in the figure below. You will have to find the length of a side of the square when a side of the regular pentagon is given. \n\n                \n                    \n                    \u200bFig: Square in a pentagon.","id":"1292","category":"Computational Geometry","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":1853,"solved":1135,"ratio":"61.25%"}}
