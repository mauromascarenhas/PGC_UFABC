{"output":"For each case, show the case number followed by the elegant permuted summation.","input":"The first line of input is an integer T (T  < 100) that represents the number of test cases. Each case consists of a line that starts with n (1 < n < 51) followed by n non-negative integers separated by a single space.

Find a permutation of these n integers so that summation of the absolute differences between adjacent elements is maximized.\n    \n\tSuppose n = 4 and the given integers are  4 2 1 5. The permutation  2 5 1 4 yields the maximum summation.\n\tFor this permutation sum = abs(2-5) + abs(5-1) + abs(1-4) = 3+4+3 = 10.\n    \n\tOf all the 24 permutations, you won\u2019t get any summation whose value exceeds 10.
