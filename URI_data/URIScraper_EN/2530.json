Everyone handed over a sheet containing only their answers and the respective indices. Teacher Maria Eduarda suspects that Ricardinho copied his answers from Juan, the best student in the class.\r\n\r\nRicardinho was called to talk with the teacher during the break time, in order to check if he really cheated or not. However, afraid of being caught, the prankish boy distracted the teacher and erased the indices of his answers. Hence, if the sheet contained initially \"1) 20 2) 30 3) 35 ...\", now it contains only \"20 30 35 ...\".\r\n\r\nThe exam was composed of N questions, which answers were always numbers. However, the boy answered only M of them. The teacher is sure that Ricardinho wrote down his answers in order, i.e., if he answered, for example, questions 2 and 4, then the answer for question 2 is wrote before the answer for question 4.\r\n\r\nWith all the N answers gave by Juan, also in order, Maria Eduarda will nullify Ricardinho\u2019s exam if there is some way to match the value of the M answers given by Ricardinho with M of the N answers given by Juan, respecting their orders.\r\n\r\nWrite a program that, given the answers of both boys, determine if Ricardinho\u2019s exam must be nullified.","id":"2530","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":458,"solved":177,"ratio":"38.65%"}}
