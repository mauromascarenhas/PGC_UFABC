{"output":"For each case, output a single line, the amount of false signatures found.","input":"There will be several test cases. The first line of each case starts with an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50) representing the amount of students in the class. The next N lines will be as follows:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t                           Student Name   Student Original Signature\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThen there will be an integer M (0 ≤ M ≤ N), representing the number of students attending the class. M lines follow in the following format:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t                               Student Name   Signature of the day\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAll students have only the first name on the list, all names are different and contain no more than 20 letters (a-z A-Z).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe input ends with N = 0, which should not be processed.","level":3,"name":"Help Girafales","has_images":false,"description":"Minutes before the end of the class, teacher Girafales passes an attendance list. One day he decided to check the signatures and noted that some students signed different in some classes and suspected that someone could be signing for them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the teacher has many students and not enough time (coffee with Dona Florinda is priority), he asked you to help him validate the students signatures. A signature is considered false if there is more than one difference between the original and the one that is being checked. Consider difference an uppercase letter as a lowercase or vice versa.","id":"1911","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":2434,"solved":1150,"ratio":"47.25%"}}
