{"output":"For each test case, print a single line containing the value of the unknown variable.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The only line of each test case contains a string in the form R+L=J. If the value of a variable is known, such value appears in the string instead the variable itself. Otherwise, the letter that indicate the variable appears normally.\r\n\r\nIt is guaranteed that exactly two of the three values are known. Also, all known values are between 1 and 106, inclusive.
