The first line of a test case contains two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000) and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 2000) respectively representing the number of types of offers that Farcos thought and the quantity of cans he has to sell . Then there are N rows referring to the offers, each containing two integers Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 100) and V (1 ≤ V ≤ 1000) specifying that Q beverage can be bought for V R$.
