After retiring from the hectic life of a hero, he now works as a tile designer. We will imagine a wall of tiles as a grid of L * C, L lines identified from 0 to L-1 and C columns identified from 0 to C-1. Nagol has its own style of design, it uses its hands to \"scratch\" each of the tiles and turn the final wall into a great work of art.\n\nThe order he uses to do this is always the same, starts from the first row and scribbles all the C columns from left to right, then goes to the second row and scribbles all C columns in the same way, it repeats until Finish the L lines. An important detail is that he never makes two straight strokes with the same hand, alternating starting always with the right hand. Here is an example of a final wall where L = 2 and C = 3:\n\n\n\nYour task is, given the size of the wall (L and C) and the position of a specific tile (X and Y), tell which hand Nagol will use to scratch it.","id":"2579","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":991,"solved":303,"ratio":"30.58%"}}
