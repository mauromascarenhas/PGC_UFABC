{"output":"If the information gave by the spy is inconsistent and it is not possible to determine the number of houses, print a line containing -1. Otherwise, print two lines. The first line contains an integer K, the number of houses. The second line contains K integers, the number of people in each house. The integers must be printed in non-ascending order. A space must be printed between two consecutive integers.","input":"The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000), the number of people. The people are numbered from 1 to N.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe next N lines contains N characters each. The j-th character in the i-th line (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N) is S if people i and j belong to the same house, or D if people i and j belong to different houses. It is guaranteed that, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N, the j-th character in the i-th line is equal to the i-th character in the j-th line. Also, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ N, the i-th character in the i-th line is always S.","level":6,"name":"Houses of Westeros","has_images":false,"description":"Daenerys: \"Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell.
