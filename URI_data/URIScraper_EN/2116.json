Juilherme create a new game to play while they watch this online contest.\n\nThe game use the following steps:\n\n1) Juilherme choose a integer N and Jogerio choose a integer M.\n2) Juilherme e Jogerio should then find two prime numbers P1 and P2, that should be the closest integer possible when compared with N and M, respectively. Besides that, P1 should be equal or less then N and P2 should be equal or less then M.\n3) The final answer of the game is find the multiplication of P1 and P2. Who find the answer first will be the winner.\n\nThey will try to find the answer the fastest way possible, and sometimes they can make some mistake. So, they need a algorithm that delivers the final answer of the game, that will then be compared with their answer.\n\n\nUsing the information of the game, create a new program that give N and M print the final result of the game.","id":"2116","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":1000,"solved":584,"ratio":"58.40%"}}
