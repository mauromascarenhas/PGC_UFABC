Each farm, besides having many livestock creations, also has large coffee plantations. In the midst of profits, expenditures, and crop yields each year, Jhin found it necessary to predict the productivity of each crop in coffee bags based on approximate values \u200b\u200bof the production of each stand of coffee. Jhin hired a programmer to solve the problem. The programmer proposed that each crop is represented by a matrix in which the coffee grounds are represented by each cell. Each cell (coffee plant) of the matrix (crop) is filled with the values \u200b\u200bof how many liters (in grains) of coffee the foot will produce in that year.\n\nAssuming that each bag is equivalent to 60 liters of coffee, Jhin needs to know how many sacks and how many liters each crop will produce that year. However, the programmer is a beginner and now needs your help to implement the logic that he developed to solve the problem.","id":"2871","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":464,"solved":304,"ratio":"65.52%"}}
