{"output":"    For each test case in the input your program must output one line containing a real number, with 4 decimal digits precision. The number should be the weight of a minimum weight decomposition of the given polygon.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains one integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100). The following 2N lines contain, each one, two real numbers X and Y (0 ≤ X, Y ≤ 10000), with precision of 4 decimal digits: the coordinates of the 2N points, in counterclockwise order, of the convex polygon.","level":8,"name":"Cut","has_images":true,"description":"Every convex polygon, with 2N vertices, can be decomposed into N − 1 quadrilaterals, by making N − 2 straight line cuts between certain pairs of vertices. The figure below shows three different decompositions of the same polygon with N = 5. The weight of the decomposition is the sum of the lengths of its N −2 cuts.
