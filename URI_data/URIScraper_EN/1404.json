{"output":"For each input test case, your program should produce only one line of output, containing an integer indicating the highest number of your opponent\u2019s pieces that can be captured in just one turn.","input":"The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains two integers N and M, indicating, respectively, the number of lines and the number of columns of the board (3 ≤ N ≤ 20, 3 ≤ M ≤ 20 and N x M ≤ 200). The square at the bottom left corner of the board is a house. The second line contains a description of the match state. Each description consists of [(N x M)/2] integers, separated by a space, corresponding to the boards houses, that are numbered from 1 to [(N x M)/2], from the left to the right, from the nearest edge from the player to the nearest edge from the opponent. On the state match description, \u20180\u2019 represents an empty house, \u20181\u2019 represents a house with one of your pieces, and \u20182\u2019 represents a house with an opponent\u2019s piece. There are, at most, [(N x M)/4] pieces of each player on the board. The input final is indicated by N = M = 0.\n\n                \n\n                Figure 1: House\u2019s numerations in (a) board of dimensions 8 x 8 and in (b) board of dimensions 5 x 3.","level":7,"name":"MegaCheckers","has_images":true,"description":"MegaCheckers is a board game for two players, very similar to the known Checkers game. The board is rectangular, with N lines and M columns of small squares arranged in a grid N x M. The small squares are alternately colored with a bright color and a dark color, on the usual standard of a checker\u2019s board. The squares of dark colors are denominated \u201chouses\u201d (notice that, for visualization reasons, the diagrams below show houses as white squares).\n\n                At the beginning of the match, each player has a certain number of pieces, positioned on the nearest houses from the board edge that the player chose (the players choose opposite edges). During the match, the pieces can only occupy the houses on the board.\n\n                One of the movements of the game is \u201ccapture\u201d an opponent piece, jumping over it, diagonally, to the adjacent house through the piece, house that should be empty. The opponent piece is so removed from the board. The three involved houses on the capture (your piece\u2019s initial house, the house that contains the opponent\u2019s piece and the empty house, where your piece will be after the move) should be diagonally aligned and must be diagonally adjacent, as shown in the diagram below.\n\n                \n\n                In MegaCheckers a piece can capture opponent\u2019s pieces jumping diagonally forward or backward (notice that, on the existents variations of the Checkers game, a piece can only capture opponent\u2019s pieces jumping forward). You may also make a multiple capture, with one piece only, then jumping to empty houses over opponent\u2019s pieces. In a multiple capture, your piece may change direction, jumping first in one direction and then in another. You can capture just one piece in each jump, but can capture several pieces with sequentially jumps. You can\u2019t jump over a piece of yours, and can\u2019t jump the same opponent\u2019s piece more than once.\n\n                It\u2019s given the board dimensions and a description of the current match state. It is your turn to play and you must determine the maximum number of opponent\u2019s pieces that can be captured in a capture movement.","id":"1404","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":358,"solved":167,"ratio":"46.65%"}}
