{"output":"For each input case, print the minimum number of weights needed to weight the given object. ","input":"The first input line contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10000) , the number of test cases. In each of the next T lines there is one integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 2048), the weight of the object to be weighted.","level":7,"name":"Balance Scales","has_images":false,"description":"Old balance scales with two plates can still be found at fairs, laboratories and museums. In one of the plates the object to be weighed is placed and, in the other, the weights, until the balance is leveled. The weight of the object is obtained by the sum of weights in the opposite side. But some weights may also be placed together with the object to be weighed, and in that case those weights must be subtracted from the sum on the opposite side. For example, an object that weights 15 may be weighed by placing  8, 4, 2, 1, on the other side of the scale, as 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15. But it can also be weighed by placing 16 on the opposite side and 1 together with the object, for 16-1 = 15.\nIn this problem, the weights are all powers of 2 and there is only one weight of each value. You should find out the scheme that weighs a given object with integer weight, using the smallest number of weights of the type described.","id":"2895","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":154,"solved":54,"ratio":"35.06%"}}
