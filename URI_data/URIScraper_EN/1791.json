{"output":"Each test case, print a single line with \"Potencia\" (without quotes) if the matrix can be transformed, or \"Nao Potencia\" (without quotes) if not.","input":"The input consists of multiple lines. The first line contains an integer C that indicates the number of test cases. Then the first line in each test case contains an integer N (1 < N < 8) indicating the number of rows and columns of the matrix, then N lines, each with N integers d (􀀀-50000 \u0014< d <\u0014 50000) represents the matrix elements.","level":10,"name":"Discovering an Matrix","has_images":true,"description":"A matrix is a Matriz de Potencia if it meets three requisites:\n\n                    \n                    1.
