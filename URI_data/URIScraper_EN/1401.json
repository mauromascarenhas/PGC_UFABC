{"output":"For each input string print all the permutations possible in ascending order. Note that the strings should be treated, as case sensitive strings and no permutation should be repeated. A blank line should follow each output set.","input":"The first line of the input contains an integer n, which indicates how many strings to follow. The next n lines contain n strings. Strings will only contain alphanumeric and never contain any space. The maximum length of the string is 10.","level":4,"name":"Generating Fast, Sorted Permutation","has_images":false,"description":"Generating permutation has always been an important problem in computer science. In this problem you will have to generate the permutation of a given string in ascending order. Remember that your algorithm must be efficient.","id":"1401","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":2400,"solved":1047,"ratio":"43.62%"}}
