{"output":"Your program must print a single integer representing the size of the largest palindrome possible, as defined above.","input":"The input consists of two lines. The first line contains a string of capital letters S with at least 1 and a maximum of 2000 characters. The second line contains an integer N (0 ≤ N ≤ |S|), indicating the number of special positions we are interested in include the palindrome, followed by N distinct numbers from 1 to |S|, even containing the positions special S.","level":6,"name":"Palindrome","has_images":false,"description":"A palindrome is a string such that its reversal is equal to the original string. In other words, it is a string that, when read backwards, is equal to the original string. For example BANANAB is a palindrome, while BANANAS not. In this problem we are interested in an issue a little more interesting.\n\nGiven a string S, we want to find a subsequence that is a palindrome. A subsequence is a string that can be obtained from the removal of zero or more characters of the original string. For example ANNA is a subsequence of BANANAS.\n\nIt will also be given a set of S positions is called special positions. Its task is to find the size of the substring that is a palindrome and contains the largest number of possible special positions. If more than a subsequence maximizing the number of special positions, you must print the size of the largest.","id":"1941","category":"Strings","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":929,"solved":372,"ratio":"40.04%"}}
