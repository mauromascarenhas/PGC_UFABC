And Santa Claus needs to perform a series of deliveries of gifts in different locations around the world.\n\nFor those who do not know, the reindeers are sick and he will need to use the gas-powered thunder to deliver the presents.\n\nA curious fact is that the roads between cities are perfectly straight and there is a gas station in each city. Santa Claus is a very smart guy and, to avoid problems, he fills the tank with a specific value \\(X\\)  is the value of the largest road between the cities that Santa is traveling, so he knows that he will never run out of gas between the two cities and the gifts will not be stolen. In addition, it always selects the path where the largest road is as minimum as possible.\n\nCan you help the Santa Claus determine what \\(X\\) value of gas he should use?","id":"2933","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":76,"solved":31,"ratio":"40.79%"}}
