To do a census in the country is almost a war effort. The government sends to each canton a huge matrix which must be filled with every citizen\u2019s characteristics. Each one of these matrixes has the same size: on the lines there are the various ethnicities (there are thousands) and on the columns the characteristics that you want to measure (it could get to millions). We know that few elements of each of these matrixes are in fact filled with values different than zero.\r\n\r\n                    The work of the government company that does the census is, then, to receive the P matrixes M × N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), each one given through its non-null elements and calculate the sum matrix of the various matrixes.","id":"2102","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"3 / 10","submissions":494,"solved":202,"ratio":"40.89%"}}
