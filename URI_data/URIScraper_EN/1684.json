There may be streets connecting a crossing to itself, and there might be more than one street connecting two crossings.","level":6,"name":"Candy Marathon","has_images":false,"description":"It's time of the running marathons in the Land of Ooo again. Princess Bubblegum has got a map of the Candy Kingdom and now she's got to prepare the streets to hold the competitions.\n\nHer task is the following: she needs to separate the streets of the kingdom in disjoint marathon circuits, i.e., serveral disjoint paths that begin and end in the same corner. Each street must be used in exactly one circuit, or else a great rage will fall upon the kingdom. She doesn't mind the number of circuits generated, as long as there is at least one, since the marathon can be adjusted to fit the resources available.\n\nBubblegum believes that if any task is possible, she can do it. The question therefore is: can the streets of the kingdom be divided into disjoint circuits?","id":"1684","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":244,"solved":123,"ratio":"50.41%"}}
