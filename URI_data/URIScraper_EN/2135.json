For those not aware of the situation, the teacher required students to form a queue in lexicographical order (by name) with at most k permutations. This meant that many students do not even enter the room to take the test. However, this selective she resolved to redeem himself against students, and decided to apply a little trouble retrieval.\n\n                    Your task, even if not disapproved, is given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an.
