{"output":"For each test case, print the dedicated time to each activity according to the specifications. The times must be separated between blank spaces, but no blank space should be printed after the last time.","input":"The input consists of several test cases. Each line has an integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1018) and an integer A (1 ≤ A ≤ 103), indicating the available time and the number of acitivities, respectively. The number of activities will never be greater than the available time.

Recently, the leader of this sect, the much-feared Vithan Fender, realized that changes would be necessary so he can achieve his goal, and thus decided that the members not only will have to program in times of powers of 2, but also do every single kind of activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe activities will always be done in order of importance, with the first activity (programming) the most important and the last one the least important. Therefore, the members will have to organize the times for these activities according to that order, and if there's time to spare, the member must dedicate it to programming. Besides, the member must always dedicate at least 1 minute to an activity, that is, he must do every activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSince you've joined this sect recently, the leader wants you to prove the least of your worth by creating a program that, given the amount of available time of a member and the number of activities to be done, returns the time that should be dedicated to each one of these activities. Meanwhile, Vithan Fender will be dancing to the sound of Fink Ployd, its favorite axé music group.","id":"2487","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":183,"solved":39,"ratio":"21.31%"}}
