{"output":"For each test case, if Bino can earn coins on the trip, print the maximum amount of coins Bino can earn, otherwise print the minimum amount he can lose. Follow the spelling of the examples.","input":"The first line of the input contains a integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 100) representing a number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains a integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105), representing the number of cities. Each of the next N lines of the test case contains 2 integers Xi (1 ≤ Xi ≤ 107), and Ci (1 ≤ Ci ≤ 1010), representing respectively the position and value of the food in city i (1 ≤ i ≤ N).","level":9,"name":"It's a Trap Bino","has_images":false,"description":"Bino is a truck driver, and was commissioned to take the Christmas presents to the cities N. The cities are arranged in a row, and Bino wants to deliver the gifts as soon as possible. Bino begins his journey at position 0 and intends to visit all the N cities. Bino travels with his friend Pedro, an elf sent by Santa Claus to protect him.\n\nEach city has a position Xi and a food value Ci.\n\nWhen visiting a city, Bino can choose to buy food for Pedro. When Bino chooses to buy food for Pedro in a city i, he pays Ci gold coins for food, then Pedro begins to produce Xi coins for each unit of distance traveled. As a thank you, Bino always pays the food to Pedro in the city N.\n\nNote that if Pedro is already producing K gold coins, and Bino buys food in another city, Peter will start producing Xi gold coins, not K + Xi.\n\nBino wants to know how many gold coins can get while traveling from city 1 to city N.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the cities will be provided in the entry in ascending order of the position. It is also guaranteed that there are no two cities in the same position.","id":"2481","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":420,"solved":95,"ratio":"22.62%"}}
