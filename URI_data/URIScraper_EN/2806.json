With typical ingredients, unique spices, peculiar combinations and preparation methods, the dishes of the region always enchant the residents and tourists.\r\n\r\nIn this culinary there are two kinds of ingredients: ingredients typical from the North, and ingredients common to the rest of the country. A portion is a mix of ingredients (typical and/or commons) and/or other portions, and is only considered typical if more than half of its components are typical.\r\n\r\nRafael is visiting the North for the first time, and after a few meals he is very pleased with the local gastronomy. He realized that the more typical components a portion has, the more he is surprised by the taste.\r\n\r\nAfter taking some notes, Rafael asked for your help: Given the list of typical ingredients, and a list of several portions, you must tell which of these portions are typical.","id":"2806","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":194,"solved":24,"ratio":"12.37%"}}
