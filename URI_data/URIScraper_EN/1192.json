Her main hobby is to invent games or activities to play with her friends. Obviously, not all of them are so passionated about mathematics and have a lot of difficulty to solve the games offered by her. Now Paula has invented a small hobby that involves three characters: a numerical digit, one letter and one numeric digit.Â \n\n\tIf the letter is uppercase, you need to subtract the first digit of the second one. If the letter is lowercase, both digts must be added. If the DIGITS are the same, the product between these two digits must be presented. She asked his friend Marcelo, who is good at programming, to create a program that prints the solution for each sequence created by Paula.","id":"1192","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":10421,"solved":6269,"ratio":"60.16%"}}
