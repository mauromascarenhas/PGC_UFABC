{"output":"Print a line containing two values: The value for xl and the distance to the farthest hideout. Round and print both values with exactly two decimal places.","input":"The first line contains two integers N and X (1 ≤ N ≤ 5×104, 10 ≤ X ≤ 104). The next N lines indicate the positions of the hideouts. Each line contains two integers xi and yi (0 ≤ xi ≤ X, -104 ≤ yi ≤ 104, yi ≠ 0) indicating a hideout at position (xi, yi).","level":6,"name":"Cersei's Walk of Shame","has_images":false,"description":"Septa Unella: \"Shame! Shame!\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTo pay for her sins, Cersei must walk on the streets of King's Landing, naked.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us consider King's Landing as a Cartesian plane. Cersei must walk from the point (0, 0) to the point (X, 0), on a straight line. Note that, to complete her walk, Cersei is not supposed to leave the x-axis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, she plans to not complete her walk! At some point (xl, 0) (0 ≤ xl ≤ X), she will leave the route and run to one of the N hideouts in the city. She wants to be as far as possible from the original route, and thus she will run to the hideout which is the farthest from (xl, 0).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, Cersei must be at the hideout as soon as possible. Your task is to help Cersei to determine the value for xl such that, if she leaves the route at point (xl, 0), the distance to the farthest hideout is minimized.","id":"1860","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":334,"solved":169,"ratio":"50.60%"}}
