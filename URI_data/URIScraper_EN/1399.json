Each instruction (L, R, v, p) means: First, calculate how many numbers from A[L] to A[R] (inclusive) are strictly less than v, call this answer k. Then, change the value of A[p] to u*k/(R - L + 1), here we use integer division (i.e. ignoring fractional part).","id":"1399","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":1118,"solved":272,"ratio":"24.33%"}}
