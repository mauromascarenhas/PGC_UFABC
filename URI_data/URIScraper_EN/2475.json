But as Noel wants to lower costs he has defined the amount that will be paid to each helper as being the sum of the costs of each gift that he will manufacture times the amount of gifts made.\n\nYou will be given the gift list, the total helpers, and the cost of each gift, and you should help Noel find out the least amount that will be paid to make all gifts.\n\nAssuming that Noel has 4 presents with the values {5, 1, 10, 2} and 2 helpers and the division is done as follows:\nHelper 1 will manufacture gifts 1, 2 and 3 with the total of: (5 + 1 + 10) * 3 = 48\nHelper 2 will manufacture gifts 4 with the total of: (2) * 1 = 2\nIn this configuration the total to be paid will be 50, but a better configuration would be the helper 1 to keep gifts 1 and 2 and helper 2 with gifts 3 and 4, totaling 36.","id":"2475","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":315,"solved":73,"ratio":"23.17%"}}
