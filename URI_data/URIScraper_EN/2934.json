This year he put all of his reindeer in a row and decided to select the most of them, following a few rules.\n    - Reindeer can not be changed in order, ie a reindeer that is in position i in the original row should appear before the reindeer j in the chosen list, where i < j.\n    - Reindeer of two adjacent positions in the final sequence must differ exactly by 1 unit in their heights.\n\nIf that was not enough, Noel realized that this sequence had few reindeer. So she decided to include a new reindeer in the original row. Taking into account that this new reindeer can be inserted in any position and he will always choose a reindeer with the best possible height.\n\nAfter making the task a little difficult, Noel ended up getting confused and is asking for your help to find out how many reindeer can be selected taking into account the rules imposed.","id":"2934","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"8 / 10","submissions":143,"solved":37,"ratio":"25.87%"}}
