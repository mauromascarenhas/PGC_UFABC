When they play the game of master says, a game where someone gives an order and someone fulfills it, and instead of giving nice orders like climbing a tree, jumping the wall, doing a handstand or organizing manifestations to overthrow the government (regardless of who is in power) he always asks for something dull. In his last game, Laércio demanded that Armandinho order a list of numbers, so that only the odd numbers appear and the first item is the largest, the second is the smallest, the third is the second largest, the fourth is the second smaller, and so on. As doing this by hand is very annoying, Armandinho sought your help.","id":"2812","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":922,"solved":306,"ratio":"33.19%"}}
