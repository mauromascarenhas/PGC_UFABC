A curious Berber tradition involves sharing the creation o fga pastor at the time of his death. Regardless of the number of children he has, only the eldest and youngest son are entitled to inheritance. The other children do not gain anything. Then, all animals are weighed, and the weights (rounded to the nearest integer) are considered. The flock is then divided into two parts so that in each of the animals have similar weights. More specifically, the flock is partitioned into two parts, A and B, such that, \n\n                    \n\n                    is minimal. So, the firstborn gets the part of the flock of greater weight, and the last child, gets the part of lower weight. This does not seems very fair, but it is the tradition there.","id":"1601","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":132,"solved":38,"ratio":"28.79%"}}
