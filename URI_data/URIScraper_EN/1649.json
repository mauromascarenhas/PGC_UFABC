{"output":"For each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed to create the painting or -1 if it is impossible.","input":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case starts with one line containing four integers n, m, r and c. (1 ≤ r ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ c ≤ m ≤ 100), The following n lines each describe one row of pixels of the painting you want to create. The ith line consists of m characters describing the desired pixel values of the ith row in the finished painting ('0' indicates white, '1' indicates black).\r\n\r\n                    The last test case is followed by a line containing four zeros.","level":4,"name":"Annoying Painting Tool","has_images":false,"description":"Maybe you wonder what an annoying painting tool is? First of all, the painting tool we speak of supports only black and white. Therefore, a picture consists of a rectangular area of pixels, which are either black or white. Second, there is only one operation how to change the color of pixels:\r\n\r\n                    Select a rectangular area of r rows and c columns of pixels, which is completely inside the picture. As a result of the operation, each pixel inside the selected rectangle changes its color (from black to white or from white to black).\r\n\r\n                    Initially, all pixels are white. To create a picture, the operation described above can be applied several times. Can you paint a certain picture which you have in mind?","id":"1649","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":249,"solved":156,"ratio":"62.65%"}}
