{"output":"For each test case generate 5 lines containing the top 5 digrams together with their absolute and relative frequencies. Output the latter rounded to a precision of 6 decimal places. If two digrams should have the same frequency, sort them in (ASCII) lexicographical order. Output a blank line after each test case.","input":"The input contains several test cases. Each starts with a number n on a separate line, denoting the number of lines of the test case. The input is terminated by n = 0. Otherwise, 1 ≤ n ≤ 64, and there follow n lines, each with a maximal length of 80 characters. The concatenation of these n lines, where the end-of-line characters are omitted, gives the text sample you have to examine. The text sample will contain printable ASCII characters only.","level":4,"name":"Etaoin Shrdlu","has_images":false,"description":"The relative frequency of characters in natural language texts is very important for cryptography. However, the statistics vary for different languages.
