He was considered honest, energetic and hardworking and respected by all sections of the party. He died at age 34. The city resumed its original name in 1991 by Boris Yeltsin first president of Russia, born in the city.\n\n                    On April 2, 1979, when the city was still called Sverdlovsk happened one anthrax leak of one a military factory in the city. This incident is often called \"biological Chernobyl\", and caused about 100 deaths, though the exact number of victims and contaminated's people is unknown. The Soviet Union denied for years the real causes of the accident and all records of the victims had disappeared, because it could have revealed serious violations of the Biological Weapons Convention.\n\n                    The Soviet authorities had to resort to highly sophisticated decontamination procedures, especially in rural areas. Each rectangular area of \u200b\u200bdimensions N by M yards has divided into M × N square sections of one square yards. These sectors are identified by the coordinates of their centers, numbered from east to west and from south to north from (1, 1).\n\n                    Each sector is considered decontaminated if it is covered by at least K agents health. Each agent was able to cover a circular area. The radius of this area varied depending on the equipment used and the experience of the health agent. Your task is to determine how many of these sectors are considered decontaminated, in other words, covered by at least K agents. Consider that a sector is covered if its center is an area covered by a health agent.","id":"2113","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"undefined","submissions":-1,"solved":-1,"ratio":"undefined"}}
