{"output":"For each test case print the number of sequences Null in the given sequence.","input":"The first line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105), that is the quantity of numbers chosen by Chico. In the second of the test case line contains the N integers Vi (-106 ≤ Vi ≤ 106) separated by spaces representing the elements of the sequence.","level":7,"name":"Null Sequences","has_images":false,"description":"Chico won a list of integers on his birthday and he called his friend Mário to play with it. The play is: \"Chico will choose N numbers from the list and will put them in a random sequence, and Mário will have to say if there is a Null Sequence in this new sequence at least.\". Let's call Null Sequence a contiguous sequence of integers where in the sum of all elements are equals to zero.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGiven the result of the first test case: (-2,-1,0,1,2).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExample Null Sequences: (-2,-1,0,1,2), (-1,0,1), (0).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tExample not Null Sequences: (-1,1), (-2,0,2), (1).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tChico is furious because Mario is winning all the time, so he decided to hinder the game. Now he will not have to say wheter or not a Null Sequences, but to say how many sequences in the list are sequences Null. Now who's getting angry is Mário and you have to help him without the Chico notice.","id":"1900","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":652,"solved":225,"ratio":"34.51%"}}
