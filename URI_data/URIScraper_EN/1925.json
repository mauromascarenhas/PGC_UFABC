Today is the first day of the convention and the opening is about to start, it\u2019ll be at the auditorium of the mall. Some people already took their places, there a lot of boys, but also many girls. To be around girls makes Ordan very happy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOrdan wants to sit at a chair of the room that's adjacent to the maximum number of girls together, so then he can flirt with them, of course. The room can be seem as a two dimension matrix, and the chairs are identified by two integers, the number of the column and the number of the row.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf there\u2019s an \u2018n\u2019 in the position it means that is a girl sitting in that chair, if there\u2019s a \u2018b\u2019 it means there\u2019s a boy sitting in the chair, in the case of an \u2018*\u2019 it means the chair of that position is empty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t    1 2 3 4\n\n\t\t\t\t\t1  n n n n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2  b n * n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3  n b * b\n\n\t\t\t\t\t4  b b n b\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this example, there are two empty chairs, if Ordan sit in the chair (2,3) he will be close to 6 girls that are together, in the other hand if he sits in the chair (3, 3) he will be close to only a girl, so he prefers to sit in the (2,3).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYour task is to determine which empty chair Ordan must sit to be around the maximum number of girls. In the case of a draw you must pick the one in the position more at north, if it is still a draw you must pick the one more at left.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt\u2019s guaranteed that will always have an empty chair.","id":"1925","category":"Graph","statistics":{"level":"10 / 10","submissions":736,"solved":129,"ratio":"17.53%"}}
