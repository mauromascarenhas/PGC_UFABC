One of them is the Steal Pack that Dr. Silvano Barbosa de Campos invented to play with N cards numbered from 1 to N. You get these cards shuffled, and you must take one by one and put them in a pack, but can only put a card on the pack, if the card at the top of the pack is smaller than this one, otherwise you will steal cards until you find a smaller one. In the end your score is the sum of the cards you stole. As this game was tiring, you were asked to have an algorithm that, given the sequence of cards, indicates the sum you have stolen.","id":"2675","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":414,"solved":140,"ratio":"33.82%"}}
