{"output":"For each test case, the output should appear the word Parede, followed by a space, the case number and two points. From the following line should show the wall formed by M rows and N columns, separated by a space, describing how was the wall after the punch.","input":"The first line of input contains an integer C ( 1 ≤ C ≤ 100 ) , indicating the number of test cases. This line is followed by the test cases. Each case is described by four integers M, N , X and Y ( 1 ≤ X ≤ M ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ Y ≤ N ≤ 100 ) representing the number of lines wall and columns, and coordinates where the punch was given away. Then follow M rows with N integers Z ( 1 ≤ Z ≤ 90 ), separated by a space, representing the original values \u200b\u200bof each wall block.","level":4,"name":"Rulk's Punch","has_images":false,"description":"One day, a group of scientists decided to calculate the power of destruction about the punch of Superhero Rulk, from the Programmers. They found that the punch itself affect any wall, from the smallest to the giants. Thus able to synthesize this effect as follows: They turned the walls into a MxN matrix in its present state of destruction by setting integer values \u200b\u200bto each coordinate of the wall, and 0 to less destroyed, going up to 100, more destroyed. In addition , they determined what the exact coordinates of the punch. They found that the punch coordinate value increase by 10 points in a state of destruction, becoming more fragile; and the adjacent coordinates to this point would increase by 9 points; adjacent to these coordinates increase by 8 points; and so on. And when it was 1 point , the rest of the wall also increase at one point, affecting the entire wall.","id":"2151","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"4 / 10","submissions":693,"solved":344,"ratio":"49.64%"}}
