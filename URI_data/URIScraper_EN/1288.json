{"output":"The output is based on whether the total damage of the loads fired is equal or bigger than the castle's total resistance. If true, the program should print \"Missao completada com sucesso\", else the output must be \"Falha na missao\". ","input":"The first line of input contains the number of test cases. Each test case begin with a line containing a integer N  (1 ≤ N ≤ 50), that represents the number of lead pieces available. Follow N lines containing two integer X and Y each, representing respectively the amount of destruction power and projectil (bullet) weight. The next line contains an integer K (1 ≤ K ≤ 100) that represents the load capacity of the cannon and the last line of each test case contains an integer R that indicates the castle total resistance.","level":5,"name":"Destruction Cannon","has_images":false,"description":"The \"Destruction Cannon\" game is very simple to be understood. You have been assigned a mission to destroy a castle, knowing that it has an integer number R, which represents the value of its max resistance. To accomplish your mission, you've received a cannon that is loaded with lead, and it has a maximum loading capacity K expressed in kilos. It is possible to exist pieces of lead with the same weight but with different destructive power and this is not so important. To each projectil that hit the castle, its destruction power amount must be subtracted from the castle total resistance.\n                 \n                    Considering that the cannon can be loaded only once, respecting your limits of kilos, your task is to load the cannon with projectiles that do not exceed its load limit but do the most damage possible to know if the mission has been completed or not.","id":"1288","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":3926,"solved":1822,"ratio":"46.41%"}}
