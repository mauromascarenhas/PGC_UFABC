{"output":"For each test case output the sum of the biggest elements in each sub-vector.","input":"The input for this problem is really singular, ready carefully! On the first line you have an integer T (T = 200) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case you will receive three integers, N (1 ≤ N ≤ 104* or 1 ≤ N ≤ 106**), K (1 ≤ K ≤ N) and S (0 ≤ S ≤ 109). To generate the vector of integers use the following C/C++ code that we recommend you to copy (control+C) from this statement:\n                    \n                    array[0] = S;\n                    for (i = 1; i < N; ++i)\n                        array[i] = (1LL*array[i-1]*1103515245 + 12345) % (2147483648LL);\n                    \n                    It is guaranteed that there is a solution that is not based on the properties of the above generator.\n                    \n                    *for around 90% of the cases;\n                        **for the other test cases.","level":6,"name":"Greedy","has_images":false,"description":"Given a vector of integers of size N and an integer K, find the biggest element of each continuous sub-vector of size K.
