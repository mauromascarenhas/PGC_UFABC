Triangle, square, hexagon can easily be constructed, but, can we construct a regular heptagon? It was the German mathematician Gauss (1777-1855) who first proved that one could construct a 17-sided regular polygon and later, in one the of the most beautiful math works of all time (Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, 1798), he gave sufficient conditions to decide which regular polygons can be constructed.","id":"1577","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":572,"solved":223,"ratio":"38.99%"}}
