{"output":"The first line of each set contains the value of N and M. The next N lines \n\tcontain N numbers, sorted according to the rules mentioned above. Print the last two zeroes of the input file in the output file also.","input":"The input file contains many sets of inputs. Each set starts with two integers N (0 < N ≤ 10000) and M (0 < M ≤ 10000) which denotes how many numbers are within this set. Each of the next N lines contains one number each. These numbers should all fit in 32-bit signed integer. Input is terminated by a line containing two zeroes.","level":5,"name":"Sort! Sort!! And Sort!!!","has_images":false,"description":"Hmm! Here you are asked to do a simple sorting. You will be given N numbers and a positive integer M. You will have to sort the N numbers in ascending order of their modulo M value. If there is a tie between an odd number and an even number (that is their modulo M value is the same) then the odd number will precede the even number. If there is a tie between two odd numbers (that is their modulo M value is the same) then the larger odd number will precede the smaller odd number and if there is a tie between two even numbers (that is their modulo M value is the same) then the smaller even number will precede the larger even number. For remainder value of negative numbers follow the rule of C programming language: A negative number can never have modulus greater than zero. E.g. -100 MOD 3 = -1, -100 MOD 4 = 0 etc.","id":"1252","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":5814,"solved":1847,"ratio":"31.77%"}}
