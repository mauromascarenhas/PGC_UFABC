Fortunately, over the years, many films have reached the Tupiniquins lands. Nicole is a cinematic girl, and loves all genres. Every year she attends many films and makes her mark for the Oscars (annual awards). Years have passed and she has hit many categories. However, Nicole would like to further improve her hunches. For this, I would like to analyze all your hunches from previous years, and observe in which categories are wrong most, so that in the current year, pay more attention to these categories. The main categories of the Oscars are: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Actor. And only these categories matter for this problem (there are 24 currently). To facilitate, we will list the categories from 1 to 4. Tarantino's newest film, his favorite director, has just left, and Nicole is very busy watching, so he asked you, given the list of Oscar nominees, and your hunches, N years, indicate in which categories focus on the current year.","id":"2961","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":33,"solved":22,"ratio":"66.67%"}}
