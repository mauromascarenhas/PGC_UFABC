{"output":"For each test case, your program must print a single line containing the name of the winning competitor, the fastest. If there is a tie and you can not determine a single winner, you should print the word \"Empate\" (it means tie in Portuguese) without quotes.","input":"Each test case consists of a single line containing three numbers, separated by a blank space, O (0 ≤ O ≤ 100), B (0 ≤ B ≤ 100) and I (0 ≤ I ≤ 100), representing respectively the time in seconds of Otavio, Bruno and Ian. Times will have a maximum of 3 decimal places.","level":2,"name":"What is the Fastest?","has_images":false,"description":"Otavio, Bruno and Ian are childhood friends, passionate about challenges and water sports. In Olympic times they challenge each other, simulating some competitions such as swimming. The problem is that swimming, for example, they train enough together and sometimes the time difference between them is very short, due to this, in most cases they are hours and hours discussing who won. Now they decided to invest in the development of electronic equipment to be used specifically in swimming, which identifies the time that each swam and displays who was the fastest. You're part of the team that will develop the equipment and your task in the project is to create a program to receive the time of 3 friends and say who was the winner.","id":"2175","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":2366,"solved":1371,"ratio":"57.95%"}}
