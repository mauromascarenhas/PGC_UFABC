A pizza which just touches the border of the table without intersecting it is considered fitting on the table, see example 3 for clarification.","input":"The input file contains several test cases. Each test case starts with an integer number R, the radius of the surface of the round table the contestants are sitting at. Input is terminated by R = 0. Otherwise, 1 ≤ R ≤ 1000. Then follow 2 integer numbers W and L specifying the width and the length of the pizza, 1 ≤ W ≤ L ≤ 1000.","level":3,"name":"Alfredo's Pizza Restaurant","has_images":false,"description":"Traditionally after the Local Contest at Louisiana, judges and contestants go to their favourite restaurant, Alfredos Pizza Restaurant.
