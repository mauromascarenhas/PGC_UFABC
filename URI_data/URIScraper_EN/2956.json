The derivative of a function y = f (x) can also be represented by the symbols: y ', dy / dx or f' (x). The derivative of a function f (x) at point x0 is given by:\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIn classical geometry, the line tangent to the graph of the function f in a was the only line that passed through the point (a, f (a)) that did not find the graph of f across, meaning that the line did not pass directly through the graph. The slope of the secant to the graph of f in the image above, which passes through the points (x, f (x)) and (x + h, f (x + h)) is given by the quotient of Newton:\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tAn alternative definition is: The function f is differentiable in a if there exists a function φa of I in continuous R in a such that:\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tFor example, if we consider the function f of R in R defined by f (x) = x² + x - 1, it is differentiable in 0. It is possible to observe in the image below the graphs of the constraints of that function at intervals [-1 , (1) and [-1 / 10,1 / 10] and it is clear that while the former is rather curved (and hence f (x) - f (0) is far from linear) is practically indistinguishable from a line segment (from slope 1). In fact, the more the graph is enlarged near (0, f (0)), the closer it is to being linear.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tWhen we derive the derivative of a function, the result is also a function of x and as such can also be differentiated. Calculating the derivative again yields the second derivative of the function f. Similarly, the derivative of the second derivative is called the third derivative, and so on. We can refer to the subsequent derivatives of f by:\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tIf f is a function with real values \u200b\u200bin R, then the partial derivative of f measures its variation in the direction of the coordinate axes. For example, if f is a function of x and y, then its partial derivative measures the change in f in the x-direction and y-direction. However, they (partial derivatives) do not directly measure the variation of f in any other direction, such as that along the diagonal line y = x. These are measured using the directional derivatives. We can calculate the derivative of a function with 13 variables by means of ... \"fake news, ok?
