He began to read historical references, to study the main algorithms and to search for articles and news that approached the subject in the most different aspects.\n\nHowever, the large volume of information gained in a short period of time has led to some questions and fears. Worried about quantum computing, which in theory would cripple RSA encryption, and motivated by the history of the DES algorithm, which had a more secure evolution called 3DES, he decided to propose a more secure version of RSA, called 3-RSA.\n\nIn 3-RSA, the module n, composed in the original algorithm by two distinct prime numbers, would now consist of 3 distinctly odd primes! Pedro was right that this modification would bring greater difficulty in breaking the algorithm, since the attackers now would have to find 3 factors of n, not only 2.\n\nKnowing that in cryptography, sometimes less is more, and willing to show to the motivated and well-intentioned Peter that the proposed modification actually weakens the RSA, factor the n module of the 3-RSA algorithm, showing its three prime factors.","id":"2636","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":991,"solved":278,"ratio":"28.05%"}}
