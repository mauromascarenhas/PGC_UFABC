It truly is a marvelous view, with its variety of mounts and its bountiful colors. He specially enjoys the lighter  ones, which are more distant.\n\n\n\n\n\nYours friends from other places say that not all mounts are light, and that some have dark vegetation ,but, as they are truly distant they seem light. They also say that this is related to the atmospheric perspective, an effect that make the distant mounts seem lighter than the close ones. Renato wants to show that in his city the mounts are truly lighter the more distant the are from his house, e to do so he noted the distance and the tonality of each one.
