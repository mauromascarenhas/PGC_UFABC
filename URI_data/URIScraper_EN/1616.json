His classmates decided to celebrate the graduation organizing a ball, where there would be live music, food and free drinks. As all balls, the most expected moment is the one in which everyone starts to dance in pairs.\n\n                    The pairs will be formed between a boy and a girl, and as Rafael's classmates are so shy, that they decided to plan ahead what the pairs would be.

This implies that, if everyone wants to dance at least once, one or more girls will have to dance with more than one boy.\n\n                    Rafael asked your help: in how many ways the pairs can be formed, in such a way that all the boys dance exactly once, and all the girls dance at least once?","id":"1616","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":485,"solved":251,"ratio":"51.75%"}}
