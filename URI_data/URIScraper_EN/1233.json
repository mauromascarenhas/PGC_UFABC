{"output":"For each test case, your program must print a single line containing a single integer, indicating the number of complete stars that can be drawn.","input":"The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains a single line, containing a single integer N (3 ≤ N < 231), indicating the number of arcs in which the circumference was divided.","level":7,"name":"Star","has_images":true,"description":"Fernando won a compass for his birthday, and now his favorite hobby is drawing stars: ﬁrst, he marks N points on a circumference, dividing it into N equal arcs; then, he connects each point to the k-th next point, until returning to the ﬁrst point.\n\t\n\tDepending on the value of k, Fernando may or may not reach all points marked on the circumference; when that happens, the star is called complete. For example, when N = 8, the possible stars are shown in the ﬁgure below. Stars (a) and (c) are complete, \n\twhile stars (b) and (d) are not.\n\n\t\n\n\tDepending on the value of N, it may be possible to draw many diﬀerent stars; Fernando asked you to write a program that, given N, determines the number of complete stars he can draw.","id":"1233","category":"Mathematics","statistics":{"level":"7 / 10","submissions":2152,"solved":768,"ratio":"35.69%"}}
