For example: The string 'casa' contains as a substring the string 'cs', but does not contain the string 'ac'.\n\nAfter some time analyzing these properties, Dabriel realized that to generate the third string it was enough to concatenate the other two, a very trivial thing. Therefore, he asked for his help to determine the size of the smallest string that has both as a substring.","id":"2842","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":132,"solved":65,"ratio":"49.24%"}}
