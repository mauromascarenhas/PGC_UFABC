{"output":"For each test case print \u201cCaso #X: Y\u201d, where X is the number of the current case, beginning with 1, and Y is the number of stars that are protected by some camera.","input":"The first line contains T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10\u2079) and C (1 ≤ C ≤ 10\u2074), the length of the sidewalk and the number of installed cameras, respectively. Following there are C lines, each one describing the camera i with two integers ai and bi (1 ≤ ai ≤ bi ≤ N), representing the range covered by the camera. The next line contains a number E (1 ≤ E ≤ 10\u2074), the number of stars. Following, there is a line with E integers xi, indicating the position of the i-th star on the sidewalk (1 ≤ xi ≤ N).","level":8,"name":"Walk of Fame","has_images":true,"description":"In Hollywood Walk of Fame, there are numerous stars on the sidewalk with the name of many famous artists.
