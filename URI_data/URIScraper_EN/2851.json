It is possible that there is no aj that satisfy the condition, so the answer is \u201c*\u201d;\n\tThe player must enter a array M such that | M | = | V | and the game says whether he hit or not.\n\n\nFor example the array V = [1, 4, 7, 5], for a1 = 1 the answer will be 4 which is in position a2, since a2 > a1 and the index 2 > 1 and a2 is closest to a1, a2 = 4 the answer will be 7 which is in the position a3, since a3 > a2 and the index 3 > 2, already for a3 = 7 the answer will be \u201c*\u201d since there is no aj (j > 3 and j ≤ | V | which satisfies the conditions of the game, the same happens for a4 = 5. Thus the response to be typed in the console is the array M = [4, 7, *, *].\n\nRangel has no time to feed the database with the correct answers as he is preparing for a competition and asks you to create the answers for him, because the semester is almost starting and the teacher is waiting for the game.\n\nGiven array V, you must create an algorithm that generates the sequence M following the rules of the game.","id":"2851","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"9 / 10","submissions":606,"solved":110,"ratio":"18.15%"}}
