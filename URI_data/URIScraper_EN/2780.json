{"output":"Your program should produce a single line, containing an integer, 1, 2, or 3, indicating the launch season.","input":"The first and only line of the input contains an integer D (0 ≤ D ≤ 2000) indicating the distance of the robots to the start of the block, in centimeters, at launch.","level":1,"name":"Robot Basketball","has_images":true,"description":"The OIBR organization, the International Robot Basketball Olympiad, is starting to have problems with two teams: the Bit Warriors and the Byte Bulls. It's just that the robots on these teams hit almost every pitch from any position on the court! Come to think of it, the basketball game would be awkward if players could hit any pitch, right? One of the measures that the OIBR is implementing is a new score for the launches, according to the distance from the robot to the beginning of the court. The court is 2000 centimeters long, as in figure.\n\nGiven the distance D of the robot to the beginning of the court, where the basket is, the rule is as follows:\n\n\u2022 If D ≤ 800, the basket is worth 1 point;\n\n\u2022 If 800 < D ≤ 1400, the basket is worth 2 points;\n\n\u2022 If 1400 < D ≤ 2000, the basket is worth 3 points. The OIBR organization needs help to automate the game's scoreboard. Given the value of distance D, you must write a program to calculate the number of launch points.","id":"2780","category":"Beginner","statistics":{"level":"1 / 10","submissions":2666,"solved":1994,"ratio":"74.79%"}}
