{"output":"For each test case of your program, print a single line where you will see a sentence containing all the characters related to your test case.","input":"The input is composed of several test cases. The first line of the test case contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 100000), the next N lines contain a String B (00000001 <= B <= 11111111).

Like many of his friends, he knows how to use current technologies very well. But he did not just want to know how to use it, he wanted to know how computing worked. After studying a little of the origin of the computer, Jhin realized that the computer system is not as simple as it seems to be. In the midst of some of his research, he realized that the computer uses a binary or two base system, represented by zeros and ones (0 and 1). Jhin has discovered that we can convert binary numbers to decimal numbers and that we can use a decimal value to match a character according to the ASCII table.\n\nJhin found interesting the idea of \u200b\u200bhow the computer understands what we typed and decided to develop a translator in which it would enter with values \u200b\u200bin binary and the program would return the phrase equivalent to the binary code typed. Jhin was able to develop the program, however, he challenged you programmer to solve the same problem.","id":"2874","category":"Ad-Hoc","statistics":{"level":"2 / 10","submissions":367,"solved":227,"ratio":"61.85%"}}
