{"output":"For each test case, print the expression converted to posfix expression.","input":"The first line of input is an integer N (N < 1000), that indicates the total number of test cases. Each case is a valid expression in the infix format.","level":5,"name":"Infix to Posfix","has_images":false,"description":"The teacher asked you to write a program that convert an infix expression to a postfix expression. Like you know, the terms in and pos are according with the operators position. The program will have to handle only with the binary operators +, -, *, /, ^. parenthesis, letters and numbers. An example would be an expression like:\n                    (A*B+2*C^3)/2*A. The program must convert this expression (infix) to the posfix expression: AB*2C3^*+2/A*\n                    All expressions of the test cases are expressions with valid sintax.","id":"1077","category":"Data Structures and Libraries","statistics":{"level":"5 / 10","submissions":5433,"solved":1980,"ratio":"36.44%"}}
