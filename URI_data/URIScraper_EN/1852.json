There are five pups, one for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.\"\n\nDuring a trip, Ned Stark found N direwolf pups and decided to give each pup to one of his N children. Ned wants to make both his children and the direwolves happy, so he wants to find the ideal assignment of children and direwolves.\nAfter playing with the pups for a while, each children gave Ned a list of pups in order of preference, i.e., each children wants to have the pup which is on the top of his/her list; if this is not possible, the children wants the pup which appears second in the list, and so on.\nAfter observing how each direwolf reacts to each children, Ned also deduced, for each direwolf, the list of children it wants to be its owner, also in order of preference.\nNed must find an assignment such that, for any children Ci and any direwolf Dj, it does not happen that Ci prefers Dj over his direwolf and Dj prefers Ci over its owner. If there is more than one possible assignment, Ned wants the assignment such that each children has the best (most preferable) pup he/she can have.","id":"1852","category":"Paradigms","statistics":{"level":"6 / 10","submissions":104,"solved":64,"ratio":"61.54%"}}
